  doi = {10.1016/j.brainres.2015.06.052},
  abstract = {A variety of exercise protocols have been used to promote experimental neuroplasticity. However, the plastic brain responses generated by several aspects of training (types, frequency, regimens, duration) remain undetermined. The aim of this study was to compare the plastic changes in the glutamatergic system and synaptic proteins in motor cortex, striatum and cerebellum promoted by two different treadmill exercise regimens. The present study analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting the expression of the subunits of AMPA receptors (GluA1 and GluA2/3) and synaptic proteins (synapsin I and synaptophysin) in adult male Wistar rat brains. The animals were divided into animals subjected to two different frequencies of aerobic exercise groups and sedentary animals. The exercise groups were: intermittent treadmill exercise (ITE) - animals that exercised 3 times a week (every other day) during four weeks, and continuous treadmill exercise (CTE) - animals that exercised every day during four weeks. Our results reveal that different protocols of treadmill exercise were able to promote distinct synaptic reorganization processes among the exercised groups. In general, the intermittent exercise regimen induced a higher expression of presynaptic proteins, whereas the continuous exercise regimen increased postsynaptic GluA1 and GluA2/3 receptors.},

  abstract = {Fields studying movement generation, including robotics, psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience, utilize concepts and tools related to the pervasiveness of variability in biological systems. The concepts of variability and complexity and the nonlinear tools used to measure these concepts open new vistas for physical therapist practice and research in movement dysfunction of all types. Because mounting evidence supports the necessity of variability for health and functional movement, this perspective article argues for changes in the way therapists view variability, both in theory and in action. By providing clinical examples, as well as applying existing knowledge about complex systems, the aim of this article is to create a springboard for new directions in physical therapist research and practice.},

  abstract = {Description is given of methods that can evaluate the main functional elements of the immune system. Acute responses to exercise depend on the intensity and duration of the required activity relative to the individual's fitness level. Moderate endurance exercise causes either no change or an enhancement of such indices as total leucocyte count, granulocyte, monocyte, lymphocyte and natural killer cell count, total T cell count, helper:suppressor cell ratio, cell proliferation in response to mitogens, serum immunoglobulin levels, and in vitro immunoglobulin production. However, exhausting exercise tends to produce adverse changes in these same indices, particularly if the physical activity is accompanied by environmental or competitive stress. Moderate, appropriately graded training reduces reactions to any given absolute intensity of exercise. When pursuing a more demanding training regimen, it is important that the exerciser optimize immune responses. If athletic preparation is pursued to the level of staleness and/or muscle damage, it can have substantial negative implications for many aspects of immune function, including resistance to acute infections, HIV infections, ageing, cancer and other conditions influenced by the immune system.},

El estr\'es supone una activaci\'on psicofisiol\'ogica que puede ser positiva en determinadas situaciones pero que, mantenida en el tiempo, agota nuestras reservas y puede hacernos m\'as vulnerables ante determinadas enfermedades.
Estas reacciones no est\'an mediadas s\'olo por las demandas de la situaci\'on, sino tambi\'en por las valoraciones cognitivas que hacemos de nuestros recursos ante ellas. Estos conocimientos nos pueden permitir entender las interferencias que puede ejercer el estr\'es sobre el resultado \'optimo de nuestros tratamientos. Y, adem\'as, nos puede acercar a nuevos enfoques terap\'euticos en nuestra pr\'actica cl\'inica.
De cualquier modo, ser\'a esencial m\'as investigaci\'on para determinar los efectos de la fisioterapia sobre la respuesta al estr\'es, as\'i como el modo en que \'este interfiere en el tratamiento.
Stress represents a psycho-physiologic activation which could be positive in certain circumstances kept over time it depletes our reserves and could make us more vulnerable towards certain diseases.
These reactions are not only triggered by the demands of the situation, but also for the cognitive valuations that we make of our resources before them.
This knowledge could allow us to understand the interferencees which stress could exert over the optimum results of our treatments; and also it could bring us closer to new therapeutic approaches in our clinical practice.
Whichever way, more research will be essential to determine the effects of physiotherapy on the stress response, as well as the way in which stress interferes in our treatments.},

As a matter of fact, during these periods athletes very frequently (five to ten times more than average) fall ill. In order to correct this situation, in the USSR immunomodulator drugs are used together with high frequency electromagnetic waves which are applied on the body surface corresponding to the adrenal glands. In this way body desensitisation is accelerated. One hundred high-level athletes received an application of electromagnetic waves on the body surface corresponding to the thyroid gland and thymus, so as to lower glucocorticoid activity and activate lymphoid tissue. Indices of immunologic reactivity and hormonal levels after electromagnetic treatment were measured in all athletes.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Nonexperimental, retrospective design. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare clinical diagnostic accuracy (CDA) between physical therapists (PTs), orthopaedic surgeons (OSs), and nonorthopaedic providers (NOPs) at Keller Army Community Hospital on patients with musculoskeletal injuries (MSI) referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). BACKGROUND: US Army PTs are frequently the first credentialed providers privileged to examine and diagnose patients with musculoskeletal injuries. Physical therapists assigned at Keller Army Community Hospital have also been credentialed with privileges to order MRI studies for several years. METHODS AND MEASURES: To reduce provider bias, a retrospective analysis was performed on 560 patients referred for MRI over an 18-month period. An electronic review of each patient's radiological profile was performed to assess agreement between clinical diagnosis and MRI findings. Data analyses were performed through descriptive statistics and contingency tables. RESULTS: Analysis on agreement between clinical diagnosis and MRI findings produced a CDA of 74.5\% (108/145) for PTs, 80.8\% (139/172) for OSs, and 35.4\% (86/243) for NOPs. There was a significant difference in CDA between PTs and NOPs (P{$<$}.001), and between OSs and NOPs (P{$<$}.001). There was no difference in CDA between PTs and OSs (P{$>$}.05). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnostic accuracy by PTs and OSs on patients with musculoskeletal injuries was significantly greater than for NOPs, with no difference noted between PTs and OSs.},

  shorttitle = {A Treatment-Based Classification Approach to Low Back Syndrome},
  abstract = {We present a treatment-based classification approach to the conservative management of low back syndrome. The approach has three levels of classification based on historical information, behavior of symptoms, and clinical signs. We first distinguish patients whose conservative care can be managed predominantly and independently by physical therapists versus patients who require consultation with other services (eg, psychology) or who require referral because of possible serious nonmusculoskeletal pathology. Once patients who can be managed by physical therapists are identified, the next level of classification is to stage their condition with regard to severity. We propose three stages: stage I for patients in the acute phase where the therapeutic goal is symptom relief, stage II for patients in a subacute phase where symptom relief and quick return to normal function are encouraged, and stage III for selected patients who must return to activities requiring high physical demands and who demonstrate a lack of physical conditioning necessary to perform the desired activities safely. The remainder of the article focuses on a third level of classification for stage I only in which patients are classified into distinct categories that are treatment-based and that specifically guide conservative management. The entire approach is diagnosis based, with specific algorithms and decision rules as well as examples presented.},

The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of both change in disability and level of disability following physical therapy treatment. Subjects. The subjects were consecutive patients (n=361) who were receiving physical therapy for soft tissue shoulder disorders. Methods. Clinical response to physical therapy, which was measured using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) measure, was assessed over 12 weeks. The 28 independent baseline predictors included demographics, disorder-related and disability measures, medication use, clinical findings, and expectations for recovery. Multiple linear regression techniques were used. Results. Predictors of greater disability at discharge were: higher initial disability, therapist prediction of restricted activities at discharge, workers' compensation claim, older age, and being female. Predictors of greater improvement in disability were: shoulder surgery, higher pain intensity, shorter duration of symptoms, younger age, and poorer general physical health (measured using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]). Discussion and Conclusions. Prognostic factors differ depending on the format of the outcome. Only age was significant in both models. [Kennedy CA, Manno M, Hogg-Johnson S, et al.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose. Scapular muscle performance evaluated with a handheld dynamometer (HHD) has been investigated only in people without shoulder dysfunction for test-retest reliability of data obtained with a single scapular muscle test. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability, error, and validity of data obtained with an HHD for 4 scapular muscle tests in subjects with shoulder pain and functional loss. Subjects and Methods. Subjects (N=40) with shoulder pain and functional loss were tested by measuring the kilograms applied with an HHD during 3 trials for muscle tests for the lower trapezius, upper trapezius, middle trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles. Concurrently, surface electromyography (sEMG) data were collected for the 4 muscles. The same procedures were performed 24 to 72 hours after the initial testing by the same tester. Muscle tests were performed 3 times, and the results were averaged for data analysis. Results. Intraclass correlation coefficients for intratester reliability of measurements of isometric force obtained using an HHD ranged from .89 to .96. The standard error of the measure (90\% confidence interval [CI]) ranged from 1.3 to 2.7 kg; the minimal detectable change (90\% CI) ranged from 1.8 to 3.6 kg. Construct validity assessment, done by comparing the amounts of isometric muscle activity (sEMG) for each muscle across the 4 muscle tests, revealed that the muscle activity of the upper trapezius and lower trapezius muscles was highest during their respective tests. Conversely, the isometric muscle activity of the middle trapezius and serratus anterior muscles was not highest during their respective tests. Discussion and Conclusion. In people with shoulder pain and functional loss, the intrarater reliability and error over 1 to 3 days were established using an HHD for measurement of isometric force for the assessment of scapular muscle performance. Error values can be used to make decisions regarding individual patients. Construct validity was established for the lower and upper trapezius muscle tests; therefore, these tests are advocated for use. However, construct validity was not demonstrated for the serratus anterior and middle trapezius muscle tests as performed in this study. Further investigation of these muscle tests is warranted.},

  abstract = {Introduction. A structured and rigorous methodology was developed for the formulation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (EBCPGs), then was used to develop EBCPGs for selected rehabilitation interventions for the management of shoulder pain. Methods. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies was identified and synthesized using methods defined by the Cochrane Collaboration that minimize bias by using a systematic approach to literature search, study selection, data extraction, and data synthesis. Meta-analysis was conducted where possible. The strength of evidence was graded as level I for RCTs or level II for nonrandomized studies. Developing Recommendations. An expert panel was formed by inviting stakeholder professional organizations to nominate a representative. This panel developed a set of criteria for grading the strength of both the evidence and the recommendation. The panel decided that evidence of clinically important benefit (defined as 15\% greater relative to a control based on panel expertise and empiric results) in patient-important outcomes was required for a recommendation. Statistical significance was also required but was insufficient alone. Patient-important outcomes were decided by consensus as being pain, function, patient global assessment, quality of life, and return to work, providing that these outcomes were assessed with a scale for which measurement reliability and validity have been established. Validating the Recommendations. A feedback survey questionnaire was sent to 324 practitioners from 6 professional organizations. The response rate was 51\%. Results. Only 1 positive recommendation of clinical benefit was developed. Ultrasound provided clinically important pain relief relative to a control for patients with calcific tendinitis in the short term (less than 2 months). There was good agreement with this recommendation from practitioners (75\%). For several interventions and indications (eg, thermotherapy, therapeutic exercise, massage, electrical stimulation, mechanical traction), there was a lack of evidence regarding efficacy. Conclusions. This methodology of developing EBCPGs provides a structured approach to assessing the literature and developing EBCPGs that incorporates clinicians' feedback and is widely acceptable to practicing clinicians. Further well-designed RCTs are warranted regarding the use of several interventions for patients with shoulder pain where evidence was insufficient to make recommendations.},

The algorithm includes both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions and provides a stepwise approach for managing patients' care. While "treatment pathways" are set forth for these specific disorders, the algorithm also provides a common nonoperative protocol for general shoulder conditions that should help simplify patient management and guide clinicians to alternative therapies.},

  title = {Shoulder {{Kinematics}} and {{Impingement}}. {{Dynamic Radiostereometric}} Analysis of the Shoulder},
  abstract = {Abstract This study aimed to evaluate the three-dimensional kinematics of the shoulder joint in patients with shoulder impingement and controls with focus on three well known diagnostic tests; painful arc test (active abduction), Neer sign (passive elevation) and Hawkins sign. The shoulder rhythm, the speed of motion and if successful treatment of impingement could be associated with changes of the shoulder kinematics were studied Dynamic radiostereometry (RSA) is feasible method to study rotations and translations of the gleonohumeral joint because of its high precision. In all studies the relative motions of the glenohumeral joint was analyzed. In one of them the contribution of the motions in this joint to the absolute or global motions of the shoulder (the shoulder rhythm) was delineated. The median age of the patients and controls varied between 49-51 and 30-36 years in the different studies. 25 patients and 12 controls without shoulder symptoms were studied during active abduction (painful arc test). The humeral centre displaced medially, proximally, and anteriorly. In the patient group, slightly more (1{$\dottedsquare$}1.5 mm) proximal translation was observed in the early phase of the arc of motion. 18 patients and 11 controls were tested at Neer sign and Hawkins sign. At Hawkins sign the centre of the humeral head was positioned more laterally and superiorly in the patients than in the controls. 30 patients and 11 controls were studied during active and 21 patients and 9 controls during passive abduction to evaluate the relative and absolute motion in order to analyze the shoulder rhythm and the speed of motion at active abduction. The patient group showed more scapular and trunk motions (p=0.04) and especially up to 40\dbend. The distribution of motion between the glenohumeral joint and the trunk in both controls and patients with impingement was less than or equal to 1:1. 19 patients were randomized to three treatment options, physiotherapy (n=7), open surgery (n=7) or arthroscopic surgery (n=5). RSA studies and clinical evaluation were done before and median 29 and 24 months later. According to Constant-75 patients treated with surgery improved significantly more than those treated with physiotherapy (p{$<$}0.05). In the total material there was a tendency to increasing Constant score with increasing medial and posterior position of the humeral head center at test of Hawkins sign. In conclusion the patients showed at painful arc test an increased proximal translation and at Hawkins sign a more laterally and posterior position of the humeral head center. The glenohumeral-thoracoscapular ratio was less than or equal to 1:1 in patients and controls, where the patients had reduced glenohumeral motions in the early phase of active abduction. Correlation between changed humeral head translation after treatment during test of Hawkins sign and improvement of the Constant-75 score in the total patient material might represent causal relationship, but this findings ...},

  abstract = {Kaltenborn's convex-concave rule is a familiar concept in joint treatment techniques and arthrokinematics. Recent investigations on the glenohumeral joint appear to question this rule and thus accepted practice guidelines. An evidence-based systematic review was conducted to summarize and interpret the evidence on the direction of the accessory gliding movement of the head of the humerus (HOH) on the glenoid during physiological shoulder movement. Five hundred and eighty-one citations were screened. Data from 30 studies were summarized in five evidence tables with good inter-extracter agreement. The quality of the clinical trials rated a mean score of 51.27\% according to the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale (inter-rater agreement: [kappa]=-0.6111). Heterogeneity among studies precluded a quantitative meta-analysis. Weighting of the evidence according to Elwood`s classification and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research classification guidelines indicated that evidence was weak and limited. Poor methodological quality, weak evidence, heterogeneity and inconsistent findings among the reviewed studies regarding the direction of translation of the HOH on the glenoid, precluded the drawing of any firm conclusions from this review. Evidence, however, indicated that not only the passive, but also the active and control subsystems of the shoulder may need to be considered when determining the direction of the translational gliding of the HOH. The indirect method, using Kaltenborn's convex-concave rule as applied to the glenohumeral joint, may therefore need to be reconsidered.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a posteroanterior central vertebral pressure (PA mobilisation) on sagittal mobility of the lumbar spine in asymptomatic subjects.
On 3 separate days an experienced manipulative physiotherapist stood on a force platform and applied a PA mobilisation to L3 spinous process for 2 minutes on 18 female subjects. Prior to this, subjects acted as their own control by lying prone for the same length of time but without receiving mobilisation treatment. The force platform was used to indirectly measure the minimum and maximum peak forces, and the frequency of oscillation of the applied PA mobilisation. A CA-6000 Spine Motion Analyser (SMA) was used to measure lumbar spine flexion and extension before and after the mobilisation and control treatments. Prior to the main experiment, intra-therapist reliability of the SMA was found to be good, with no significant difference (p {$>$} 0.05) in flexion or extension range of movement between 3 days of testing and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 7.43 degrees for flexion and 8.6 degrees for extension.
The results indicated that a PA mobilisation with a mean maximum force of 92.5 N, amplitude of force oscillation of 9.6 N and a frequency of oscillation of 4.5 Hz had no significant affect (p {$>$} 0.05) on sagittal mobility of the lumbar spine in the asymptomatic subject population.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY. Optimal use of lumbar mobilisation requires a theoretical knowledge of the mechanical effects that occur. When a mobilisation force is applied the target vertebra will move with accompanying intervertebral displacements at many intervertebral joints. In addition, displacements and deformations of other tissues will contribute to the movement of the skin surface under the therapist's hands. The responses can be quantified in terms of the movements of the skin surface (described by the force-displacement relation), the absolute movement of the target vertebra, or the relative intervertebral movements. There are at least seven variables related to the manner of application of the mobilisation force that can be controlled by the therapist to alter the nature of the response. The patient's response is also determined by a number of variables related to the mechanical properties of the tissues of the spine, extra-spinal structures and the interaction between the patient and the treatment couch. Currently there is a moderate amount of information available about the effects of technique variations but there is very little data to directly link variations in the properties of specific anatomical structures with variations in either absolute or relative spinal movements or tissue loads.},

Physiotherapists with their understanding of soft tissue structure and muscle function are well positioned to effectively manage most patellofemoral problems by improving the extensibility and mobility of tight structures and improving the timing of the elongated muscles. This will involve recognising the biomechanical factors contributing to the symptoms, adequately explaining to the patient the cause of the symptoms and teaching the patient how to manage the symptoms. Specific training of certain muscles with accurate feedback to change the timing of these muscles during functional and sporting activities will be required if this problem is not to recur.},

The review revealed much less information about the relatively minor instabilities that are probably responsible for a number of chronic complaints of the type seen by manual therapists. The potential involvement of passive (ligamentous), active (musculotendinous) and neural control subsystems in maintaining the stability of the spine may go some way to explaining the spectrum of conditions included under the term clinical instability.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY. The use of mobilisations with movement (MWM) for peripheral joints has been developed by Mulligan. A mobilisation is applied parallel or at right angles to the restricted joint movement. If the applied mobilisation achieves immediate improvement in the functional movement and abolishes the pain the treatment involves sustaining the mobilisation while the patient performs the active movement repetitively. On reassessment of the joint function, the movement should remain improved without the mobilisation. Theories as to why these techniques provide rapid improvement in pain-free range are proposed, and the general principles of examination and treatment are outlined. Specific clinical examples demonstrate how MWM can be used in isolation or integrated with other manual approaches to improve the quality of joint intraarticular gliding, neurodynamics and the facilitation of correct muscle recruitment.},

  abstract = {A sustained natural apophyseal glide (SNAG) is a mobilization technique commonly used in the treatment of painful movement restrictions of the cervical spine. In the manual therapy literature, the biological basis and empirical efficacy of cervical SNAGs have received scant attention. In particular, an examination of their potential biological basis in order to stimulate informed discussion seems overdue. This paper discusses the likely biomechanical effects of both the accessory and physiological movement components of a unilateral cervical SNAG applied ipsilateral to the side of pain when treating painfully restricted cervical rotation. The use of flexion and extension SNAGS, and rotation SNAGS performed contralateral to the side of pain are not considered. Although a cervical SNAG may clinically be able to resolve painfully restricted cervical spine movement, it is difficult to explain biomechanically why a technique which first distracts (opens) and then compresses (closes) the zygapophyseal joint ipsilateral to the side of pain, and perhaps slightly distracts the uncovertebral cleft, would be superior to a technique which distracts the articular surfaces with both accessory and physiological movement components. Therefore, the reported clinical efficacy of cervical SNAGs cannot be explained purely on the basis of the resultant biomechanical effects in the cervical spine.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of the current call for standardization in upper extremity research, three methods to determine the glenohumeral joint rotation centre in vivo were tested. Therefore, subjects performed humeral movements, while a 3D electromagnetic tracking device registered the motion of the humerus with respect to the scapula. For the first method to estimate the glenohumeral joint rotation centre five scapular bony landmarks served as input to regression equations. The second method fitted a sphere through the humeral position data and the third method calculated the rotation centre determining an optimal helical axis. The experiment consisted of two parts, at first one subject was measured 10 times, subsequently one observer measured 10 subjects twice and another observer measured these subjects once. The first part of the experiment demonstrated that all methods are capable to reproduce the rotation centre within 4mm, but the location of the centre differed significantly between methods (p{$<$}0.001). The second part, showed that inter- and intra-observer reliability was sufficiently for the sphere-fitting method and for the helical-axes method. The two observations of one observer differed significantly (p{$<$}0.008) using the regression method. The authors prefer the helical-axes method, it is a reliable and valid method which can be applied in movement registration of healthy subjects and patients with a shoulder endoprosthesis, it can be applied in hinge joints to determine a rotation axis instead of a rotation centre which is desirable in standardized upper extremity research, and calculation time is short.},

These are a kinematic estimation based on the calculation of instantaneous helical axes, and a geometric estimation based on a spherical fit through the surface of the glenoid. Four fresh cadaver arms were fixed at the scapula and fitted with electromagnetic sensors. Each arm was moved in different directions while at the same time the orientation of the humerus was recorded. Subsequently, each specimen was dissected and its glenoid and humeral head surfaces were digitized. Results indicate no differences between the methods. It is concluded that the method to estimate the GH center of rotation as the center of a sphere through the glenoid surface, with the radius of the humeral head, appears to be valid.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a method is described for in vivo prediction of the glenohumeral joint rotation center (GH-r), necessary for the construction of a humerus local coordinate system in shoulder kinematic studies. The three-dimensional positions of five scapula bony landmarks as well as a large number of data points on the surface of the glenoid and humeral head were collected at 36 sets of cadaver scapulae and adjacent humeri. The position of GH-r in each scapula was estimated by mathematically fitting spheres to the glenoid and humeral head. GH-r prediction from scapula geometry parameters by linear regression resulted in a RMSE between measured and predicted GH-r of 2.32 mm for the x-coordinate, 2.69 mm for the y-coordinate and 3.04 mm for the z-coordinate. Application in vivo revealed a random humerus orientation error due to measurement inaccuracies of 1.35, 0.29 and 1.26\textdegree{} standard deviation per rotation angle. The estimated total humerus orientation error including the offset error due to the regression model inaccuracy was 2.86, 0.84 and 2.69\textdegree{} standard deviation. As these errors were about 15 and 20\% of, respectively, the intra- and inter-subject variability of the humerus orientations measured, it is concluded that the method described in this paper allows for an adequate construction of a humerus local coordinate system.},

De ah\'i que la situaci\'on requiera m\'etodos descriptivos y hol\'isticos: m\'etodos cualitativos de investigaci\'on. A partir de este hecho, el presente libro trata sobre c\'omo conducir la investigaci\'on cualitativa. Cada vez hay m\'as vol\'umenes y art\'iculos que abordan enfoques cualitativos espec\'ificos, en especial la observaci\'on participante, perspicaces narraciones personales de ciertos investigadores de campo, y tratados sobre los fundamentos te\'oricos de la investigaci\'on cualitativa. Pero hasta ahora no exist\'ia ninguna obra sint\'etica que proporcionara, a quienes no est\'en familiarizados con los m\'etodos cualitativos, una perspectiva general de la gama de enfoques diferentes, y a la vez una gu\'ia sobre el modo de conducir realmente un estudio. La finalidad de este libro es cubrir esas carencias a partir de la propia experiencia de los autores como investigadores, de su perspectiva te\'orica y de sus conocimientos culturales acerca de c\'omo actuar en la vida cotidiana de manera que, a trav\'es de esas operaciones, la investigaci\'on cualitativa pueda llegar por fin a su mayor\'ia de edad.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A nonlinear finite element study of a lumbar spine with different "patterns" of multilevel intervertebral disc degeneration.
OBJECTIVE: To determine how different patterns of multilevel disc degeneration influence the biomechanical behavior of the lumbar spine.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Because of the complex etiology of low back pain, it is often difficult to identify the specific factors that contribute to the symptoms of a particular patient. Disc degeneration is associated with the development of low back pain, but its presence is not always synonymous with symptoms. However, studies have suggested that "patterns" of disc degeneration may provide insight into such pain generation rather than the overall presence of degenerative changes. Specifically, individuals with contiguous multilevel disc degeneration have been shown to exhibit higher presence and severity of low back pain than patients with skipped-level disc degeneration (i.e., healthy discs located in between degenerated discs).
METHODS: In this study, the biomechanical differences between these patterns were analyzed using a nonlinear finite element model of the lumbar spine. Thirteen separate "patterns" of disc degeneration were evaluated using the model and simulated under normal physiological loading conditions in each of the primary modes of spinal motion.
RESULTS: The results showed that stresses and forces of the surrounding ligaments, facets, and pedicles at certain vertebral levels of the spine were generally lower in skipped-level disc degeneration cases than in the contiguous multilevel disc degenerations cases even when the skipped level contained more degenerated discs.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to illustrate the biomechanics of specific patterns of disc degeneration of the lumbar spine. Using a multilevel disc degeneration model, our study provides insights as to why various patterns of disc degeneration throughout the lumbar spine may affect motion and soft tissue structures as well that may have bearing in the clinical pathway of pain generation.

  title = {Mathematical {{Modeling Of The Convex Rule At The Glenohumeral Joint And Its Application To Validate The Convex Rule Through The Analysis Of Kinematical Evidence Of The Glenohumeral Joint}}},
  abstract = {RELEVANCE: The convex rule is an important clinical rule to evaluate and treat joint dysfunctions, because it can predict the normal relationship between the arthrokinematics and osteokinematics. The suggested model will help to solve the lack of consensus on the bibliography concerning the validity of the glenohumeral convex rule. DESCRIPTION: The qualitative modeling of the glenohumeral convex rule consisted of: the simplification of the surfaces of the joints and the restriction in 2 degrees of freedom. The quantitative modeling was deduced from the condition of pure rolling motion over the translation of a circle's center (\texttheta{} multiplied by r, or \texttheta{} \texttimes{} r) with a radius (r) that rolls in an angle (\texttheta{}) over a plane. The rule's validation was made by checking that the translation of the geometric center of the humeral head (TGCHH) was lower than the predicted range by the mathematical model in each study. The analyzed studies belong to peer-reviewed journals (1976-2010) that describe glenohumeral kinematics based on the TGCHH. EVALUATION: Given a bone rotation range (\texttheta{}) and a radius of the humeral head (r), the suggested model of the convex rule predicts that TGCHH has to be lower than \texttheta{} \texttimes{} r. The convex rule was met in all of the analyzed studies. CONCLUSION: The glenohumeral convex rule model demonstrates that the convex rule is accomplished if and only if: the maximum TGCHH is lower than \texttheta{} \texttimes{} r; moreover, the convex rule was validated through the analysis of kinematical evidence in the glenohumeral joint. IMPLICATIONS: The suggested model will establish a better communication between biomechanists and physiotherapists with the establishment of an equivalence between most frequently used kinematic variables of each guild.},

  volume = {15},
  abstract = {The field of modern biomechanics has deep historical roots from the ancient Egyptians, who documented the earliest accounts of spinal injury (2600\textendash{}2200 BC), as well as from the ancient Hindus, who were noted for their treatment of spinal deformities (3500\textendash{}1800 BC). Building on this foundation, the modern explosion of spinal instrumentation introduced the concept of internal fixation for spinal stabilization, further advancing the understanding of the mechanics of musculoskeletal motion. The spine is a complex mechanical structure complete with levers (vertebrae), pivots (facets and disks), passive restraints (ligaments), and actuators (muscles). Each of these elements merits special consideration and thus is addressed individually. Understanding actions and reactions, force vectors, related component vectors, and the movements and/or deformation that they cause allows the spine surgeon to apply fundamental physical principles to clinical practice. Kinematics is the application of these physical principles toward the study of the motion of rigid bodies. Knowledge of the principles and laws that are clinically relevant regarding spinal instrumentation is crucial to success. Clinical biomechanics requires the assessment of 3 key questions: 1) how do the components of the implant connect together, 2) how does the implant connect to the spine, and 3) how does the construct function biomechanically? The ability to apply basic biomechanical principles in the clinical arena provides a framework that the surgeon can use in the clinical decision-making process.},

  abstract = {Purpose: A categorization system for SMT was sought that would be more objective than is clinically available. Such a system may serve as a means to strengthen future studies, determine operating principles, applicability, treatment effectiveness, and nature of the manipulable lesion. Study design: Literature synthesis.
Methods: A search of the indexed biomechanical and medical literature as well as a hand search of published works was conducted. The criteria for article selection consisted of studies that included measurements of mechanical characteristics of treatment techniques used under the general headings of SMT or manual therapy. A second set of studies was identified that explored the biomechanics of buckling behavior of vertebral segments as a model of the manipulable lesion. Quantitative characteristics of SMT were extracted and grouped to form a basis for classification.
Results: A total of 31 articles were identified that contained quantitative data on the biomechanical properties of SMT methods. An additional seven studies were found that quantified spinal buckling behavior. Common features of SMT procedures lead to a matrix that biomechanically characterizes the types of procedures in use. Buckling behavior was compared qualitatively with clinical observations to form a plausible and evidence-based hypothesis of the manipulable lesion.
Conclusions: There currently are a number of named systems of manual procedures. No current triage system is available that predicts which patient has the greater likelihood of benefiting from manual treatment or the procedure type. The biomechanical parameters of SMT form a systematic characterization of manual procedures. Such a system may be used in future studies to test hypotheses of treatment effect from quantitatively defined procedures. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Through the study of the interaction of these forces and their effects, the form, function and motion of our bodies can be examined and the resulting knowledge applied to promote quality of life. Under gravity and other loads, and controlled by the nervous system, human movement is achieved through a complex and highly coordinated mechanical interaction between bones, muscles, ligaments and joints within the musculoskeletal system.

Therefore, understanding the biomechanics and loading of each element during movement using motion analysis is helpful for studying disease etiology, making decisions about treatment, and evaluating treatment effects. In this article, the history and methodology of human movement biomechanics, and the theoretical and experimental methods developed for the study of human movement, are reviewed. Examples of motion analysis of various patient groups, prostheses and orthoses, and sports and exercises, are used to demonstrate the use of biomechanical and stereophotogrammetry-based human motion analysis studies to address clinical issues.

  abstract = {Biomechanical modeling of human motion often is based on simple tree-type structures with elementary joint and contact situations. This is adequate for coarse evaluation of motion parameters and their effects but insufficient for detailed analysis of joint or system/environment interactions. In this lecture, an object-oriented approach for the modeling of kinematics and dynamics of musculoskeletal motion is presented which is open for integration of arbitrarily complex subsystems and their coupling to state-of-the art numerical and visualization tools. The approach is based on the concept of kinetostatic transmission element which allows one to embed intricate kinematical dependencies in easy-to-use, multilayered objects. Based on this approach, the inverse and direct dynamics problem can be formulated in a highly-efficient and implementation-independent manner, featuring different methodologies as `flavors' of the generic transmission properties. This allows one to re-use methods developed for technical systems such as contact effects, multiloop transmission mechanisms, multidisciplinary mechatronic components, and efficient numerical solution schemes. The concepts have been implemented in the object-oriented 3D biomechanical simulation environment MobileBody featuring mechanism surrogates for joint motion, higher-order foot-ground contact, data fusion of MRI and motion capturing, composite numerical clinical scoring algorithms, optimization-based muscle activation identification, verification by interval analysis, and embedded 3D visualization.},

However, doubts remain on its real effectiveness as a clinical tool, i.e. on its capability to change the diagnostic-therapeutic practice. In particular, the conditions in which evidence of a favorable cost-benefit ratio is found and the methodology for properly conducting and interpreting the exam are not identified clearly. To provide guidelines for the use of Gait Analysis in the context of rehabilitation medicine, SIAMOC (the Italian Society of Clinical Movement Analysis) promoted a National Consensus Conference which was held in Bologna on September 14th, 2013. The resulting recommendations were the result of a three-stage process entailing i) the preparation of working documents on specific open issues, ii) the holding of the consensus meeting, and iii) the drafting of consensus statements by an external Jury. The statements were formulated based on scientific evidence or experts' opinion, when the quality/quantity of the relevant literature was deemed insufficient. The aim of this work is to disseminate the consensus statements. These are divided into 13 questions grouped in three areas of interest: 1) General requirements and management, 2) Methodological and instrumental issues, and 3) Scientific evidence and clinical appropriateness. SIAMOC hopes that this document will contribute to improve clinical practice and help promoting further research in the field.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANT NOTE: The next edition of APTA's Guide to Physical Therapist Practice, 2nd Edition, will be less an "edition" and more a "version" -- 3.0 to be precise. Guide to Physical Therapist Practice 3.0 is scheduled for release in August 2014. It will be electronic only, as the online links to outside and continually updated resources made it impossible for the Guide to be useful as a static printed book.  Especially for educators and students: No printed book means that all you need for your class work is the URL. As long as you access Guide 3.0 via the guidetoptpractice.apta.org website you'll have the most current version, semester after semester.  APTA will remove the printed Guide to Physical Therapist Practice from its catalog on June 1, and will no longer sell new copies. The result of input and collaboration among hundreds of physical therapists, the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice, Revised Second Edition, clearly defines scope of practice; guides patterns of practice; improves quality of care; promotes appropriate use of health care services; and explains physical therapist practice to insurers, policymakers, and other health care professionals. The Guide continues to be an essential resource for both daily practice and professional education.  The Guide to Physical Therapist Practice, Revised Second Edition, features:  A detailed description of the scope of physical therapist practice. Tests and measures and interventions sections with expanded clinical indications, examples of tests and measures and data generated. Examples in all sections to assist the user in examination and intervention. Preferred practice patterns grouped into four major areas: musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, cardiovascular and pulmonary, and integumentary. Tests and measures and interventions relevant to each pattern clarified.},

METHODS: The QUOROM group consisted of 30 clinical epidemiologists, clinicians, statisticians, editors, and researchers. In conference, the group was asked to identify items they thought should be included in a checklist of standards. Whenever possible, checklist items were guided by research evidence suggesting that failure to adhere to the item proposed could lead to biased results. A modified Delphi technique was used in assessing candidate items.
FINDINGS: The conference resulted in the QUOROM statement, a checklist, and a flow diagram. The checklist describes our preferred way to present the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of a report of a meta-analysis. It is organised into 21 headings and subheadings regarding searches, selection, validity assessment, data abstraction, study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis, and in the results with "trial flow", study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis; research documentation was identified for eight of the 18 items. The flow diagram provides information about both the numbers of RCTs identified, included, and excluded and the reasons for exclusion of trials.
INTERPRETATION: We hope this report will generate further thought about ways to improve the quality of reports of meta-analyses of RCTs and that interested readers, reviewers, researchers, and editors will use the QUOROM statement and generate ideas for its improvement.},

Here we analyze their efficacy, effectiveness and safety, and estimate the economic impact of their use in Spain. Material and method. Systematic review (meta-analysis) of the scientific evidence available up to January 2004, and analysis of hospital costs within a 1-year time horizon.
Results. We identified 12 published studies (5 clinical series and 7 RCTs) comparing coated stents (sirolimus or paclitaxel) with conventional stents in patient with de novo single lesions {$<$}30 mm in 2.5-3.5 mm vessels. In nearly all cases the rates of angiographic restenosis and major adverse cardiac events were lower in the coated stent group after 6-12 months. Meta-analysis showed a 69\% decrease in revascularization rate (RR=0.31; 95\%CI, 0.19-0.51). For every 1000 patients with de novo lesions, the use of a coated stent involved an additional average cost of \texteuro{} 818718. The estimated neutral price of a new stent was \texteuro{} 1448 at a market price per unit of \texteuro{} 2000.
Conclusions. At 12-month follow-up, sirolimus- or paclitaxel-eluting stents were effective and safe in patients with de novo lesions and low or medium risk of restenosis. At current market prices, the widespread use of these stents would involve an increase in health care expenditure for the different sensitivity scenarios we evaluated. More studies are needed to specify the type of patients and lesions likely to obtain the greatest clinical benefit.},

  abstract = {Variance between studies in a meta-analysis will exist. This heterogeneity may be of clinical, methodological or statistical origin. The last of these is quantified by the I2-statistic. We investigated, using simulated studies, the accuracy of I2 in the assessment of heterogeneity and the effects of heterogeneity on the predictive value of meta-analyses. The relevance of quantifying I2 was determined according to the likely presence of heterogeneity between studies (low, high, or unknown) and the calculated I2 (low or high). The findings were illustrated by published meta-analyses of selective digestive decontamination and weaning protocols. As expected, I2 increases and the likelihood of drawing correct inferences from a meta-analysis decreases with increasing heterogeneity. With low levels of heterogeneity, I2 does not appear to be predictive of the accuracy of the meta-analysis result. With high levels of heterogeneity, even meta-analyses with low I2-values have low predictive values. Most commonly, the level of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis will be unknown. In these scenarios, I2 determination may help to identify estimates with low predictive values (high I2). In this situation, the results of a meta-analysis will be unreliable. With low I2-values and unknown levels of heterogeneity, predictive values of pooled estimates may range extensively, and findings should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, quantifying statistical heterogeneity through I2-statistics is only helpful when the amount of clinical heterogeneity is unknown and I2 is high. Objective methods to quantify the levels of clinical and methodological heterogeneity are urgently needed to allow reliable determination of the accuracy of meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Falls represent one of the most common causes of injury-related morbidity and mortality in later life. Subjects with cardiovascular disorders (e.g., related to autonomic dysfunctions and postural hypotension) are at higher risk of falling. Autonomic dysfunctions increasing the risk of falling in the short and mid-term could be assessed by Heart Rate Variability (HRV) extracted by electrocardiograph (ECG). We developed three trials for assessing the usefulness of ECG monitoring using wearable devices for: risk assessment of falling in the next few weeks; prevention of imminent falls due to standing hypotension; and fall detection. Statistical and data-mining methods are adopted to develop classification and regression models, validated with the cross-validation approach. The first classifier based on HRV features enabled to identify future fallers among hypertensive patients with an accuracy of 72\% (sensitivity: 51.1\%, specificity: 80.2\%). The regression model to predict falls due to orthostatic dropdown from HRV recorded before standing achieved an overall accuracy of 80\% (sensitivity: 92\%, specificity: 90\%). Finally, the classifier to detect simulated falls using ECG achieved an accuracy of 77.3\% (sensitivity: 81.8\%, specificity: 72.7\%). The evidence from these three studies showed that ECG monitoring and processing could achieve satisfactory performances compared to other system for risk assessment, fall prevention and detection. This is interesting as differently from other technologies actually employed to prevent falls, ECG is recommended for many other pathologies of later life and is more accepted by senior citizens.},

RESULTS: Fall was evaluated in 447 events, 16 patients experienced recurrent fall. Pain, emotional distress, urinary problems and fever were significant differences between admission day and fall occurred day. There were explored significant MFS risk factors in risk group, history of falling, second diagnosis, IV catheter status, medication concerning fall risk, mental status, general weakness and gait in MFS subscales.
DISCUSSION: Routine fall screening is important for early detection of fall. Identification of high-risk group and using fall prevention guidelines could improve prevention of fall.},

The aims of this study were (1) to determine which combinations of fall risk factors were associated with the occurrence of recurrent falls in older community-dwellers, and (2) to compare the efficacy of RT and multiple logistic regression model for the identification of recurrent falls.
METHODS: A total of 1,760 community-dwelling volunteers (mean age {$\pm$} standard deviation, 71.0 {$\pm$} 5.1 years; 49.4 \% female) were recruited prospectively in this cross-sectional study. Age, gender, polypharmacy, use of psychoactive drugs, fear of falling (FOF), cognitive disorders and sad mood were recorded. In addition, the history of falls within the past year was recorded using a standardized questionnaire.
RESULTS: Among 1,760 participants, 19.7 \% (n = 346) were recurrent fallers. The RT identified 14 nodes groups and 8 end nodes with FOF as the first major split. Among participants with FOF, those who had sad mood and polypharmacy formed the end node with the greatest OR for recurrent falls (OR = 6.06 with p {$<$} 0.001). Among participants without FOF, those who were male and not sad had the lowest OR for recurrent falls (OR = 0.25 with p {$<$} 0.001). The RT correctly classified 1,356 from 1,414 non-recurrent fallers (specificity = 95.6 \%), and 65 from 346 recurrent fallers (sensitivity = 18.8 \%). The overall classification accuracy was 81.0 \%. The multiple logistic regression correctly classified 1,372 from 1,414 non-recurrent fallers (specificity = 97.0 \%), and 61 from 346 recurrent fallers (sensitivity = 17.6 \%). The overall classification accuracy was 81.4 \%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that RT may identify specific combinations of risk factors for recurrent falls, the combination most associated with recurrent falls involving FOF, sad mood and polypharmacy. The FOF emerged as the risk factor strongly associated with recurrent falls. In addition, RT and multiple logistic regression were not sensitive enough to identify the majority of recurrent fallers but appeared efficient in detecting individuals not at risk of recurrent falls.},

  volume = {27},
  issn = {1528-1159},
  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of individual characteristics and physical and psychosocial workplace factors on neck/shoulder pain with pressure tenderness in the muscles.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Controversy prevails about the importance of workplace factors versus individual factors in the etiology of pain in the neck and/or shoulders.
METHODS: Study participants were 3123 workers from 19 plants. Physical risk factors were evaluated via video observations, and psychosocial risk factors were assessed with the job content questionnaire. Other procedures included symptom survey, clinical examination, and assessment of health-related quality of life (SF-36). The main outcome variable, neck/shoulder pain with pressure tenderness, was defined on the basis of subjective pain score and pressure tenderness in muscles of the neck/shoulder region.
RESULTS: The prevalence of neck/shoulder pain with pressure tenderness was 7.0\% among participants performing repetitive work and 3.8\% among the referents. We found an association with high repetitiveness (prevalence ratio 1.8, 95\% confidence interval 1.1-2.9), high force (2.0, 1.2-3.3), and high repetitiveness and high force (2.3, 1.4-4.0). The strongest work-related psychosocial risk was high job demands (1.8, 1.2-2.7). Increased risk was also associated with neck/shoulder injury (2.6, 1.6-4.1), female gender (1.8, 1.2-2.8), and low pressure pain threshold (1.6, 1.1-2.3). Neck/shoulder pain was strongly associated with reduced health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Work-related physical and psychosocial factors, as well as several individual risk factors, are important in the understanding of neck/shoulder pain. The findings suggest that neck/shoulder pain has a multifactorial nature. Reduced health-related quality of life is associated with subjective pain and clinical signs from the neck and shoulders. The physical workplace factors were highly intercorrelated, and so the effect of individual physical exposures could only be disentangled to a minor degree.},

  abstract = {Neck pain is the fourth leading cause of disability, with an annual prevalence rate exceeding 30\%. Most episodes of acute neck pain will resolve with or without treatment, but nearly 50\% of individuals will continue to experience some degree of pain or frequent occurrences. History and physical examination can provide important clues as to whether the pain is neuropathic or mechanical and can also be used to identify "red flags" that may signify serious pathology, such as myelopathy, atlantoaxial subluxation, and metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging is characterized by a high prevalence of abnormal findings in asymptomatic individuals but should be considered for cases involving focal neurologic symptoms, pain refractory to conventional treatment, and when referring a patient for interventional treatment. Few clinical trials have evaluated treatments for neck pain. Exercise treatment appears to be beneficial in patients with neck pain. There is some evidence to support muscle relaxants in acute neck pain associated with muscle spasm, conflicting evidence for epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy, and weak positive evidence for cervical facet joint radiofrequency denervation. In patients with radiculopathy or myelopathy, surgery appears to be more effective than nonsurgical therapy in the short term but not in the long term for most people.},

  abstract = {Neck pain is becoming increasingly common throughout the world. It has a considerable impact on individuals and their families, communities, health-care systems, and businesses. There is substantial heterogeneity between neck pain epidemiological studies, which makes it difficult to compare or pool data from different studies. The estimated 1 year incidence of neck pain from available studies ranges between 10.4\% and 21.3\% with a higher incidence noted in office and computer workers. While some studies report that between 33\% and 65\% of people have recovered from an episode of neck pain at 1 year, most cases run an episodic course over a person's lifetime and, thus, relapses are common. The overall prevalence of neck pain in the general population ranges between 0.4\% and 86.8\% (mean: 23.1\%); point prevalence ranges from 0.4\% to 41.5\% (mean: 14.4\%); and 1 year prevalence ranges from 4.8\% to 79.5\% (mean: 25.8\%). Prevalence is generally higher in women, higher in high-income countries compared with low- and middle-income countries and higher in urban areas compared with rural areas. Many environmental and personal factors influence the onset and course of neck pain. Most studies indicate a higher incidence of neck pain among women and an increased risk of developing neck pain until the 35-49-year age group, after which the risk begins to decline. The Global Burden of Disease 2005 Study is currently making estimates of the global burden of neck pain in relation to impairment and activity limitation, and results will be available in 2011.},

Comparisons were made with a group of healthy controls (n = 20). The average PPT differed significantly between the groups (ANOVA, F = 9.5, P \textbackslash{}textless 0.0005), largely caused by the low threshold in cervicogenic headache patients.

In the cervicogenic headache group, the lowest PPT was found in the occipital part of the head on the side with pain predominance. The ratio between the dominant and non-dominant sides (all 11 points on each side) was 0.85 in cervicogenic headache, whereas it was 0.99 in migraine patients with side preponderance of the pain. The present results support the view that the pathogenesis of cervicogenic headache differs from that of migraine and tension-type headache.

The purpose of this study was to investigate (1) "normal" pressure-pain threshold (PPT) in the biceps brachii muscle, (2) the reliability of repeated measurements of PPT in subjects without pain over 3 consecutive days, (3) the reliability of measurements of PPT between examiners, and (4) the number of measurements required to obtain a best estimate of PPT. SUBJECTS Thirty-five subjects participated in the study. METHODS Pain-pressure threshold of the biceps brachii muscle was measured using a Fischer algometer. Three test trials were done on each subject on each of 3 days by each of two examiners. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and graphical methods were used to analyze the results. RESULTS The ICCs revealed almost perfect reliability for measurements of PPT within and across 3 days and substantial reliability between examiners. The best estimate of PPT was obtained using the mean of the second and third trials each day. Graphical methods demonstrated that agreement between examiners was greatest at low mean pain thresholds. There was no effect for order of examiner. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION The PPT is a reliable measure, and repeated algometry does not change pain threshold in healthy muscle over 3 consecutive days. The PPT can be used to evaluate the development and decline of experimentally induced muscle tenderness. Reliability is enhanced when all measurements are taken by one examiner.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED We examined the relation between repeated noxious pressure over the trapezius muscle and changes in pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) in a before-after trial design. A conditioning series of 30 mechano-nociceptive stimuli was applied manually with a handheld algometer probe, and PPTs were measured over 1 trapezius muscle (skin anaesthetized) in 27 healthy women before and after the intervention. With a mean stimulation rate of 0.40 Hz and a mean nociceptive stimulation intensity of 1.78 x Threshold, subjects were found to systematically react with a change in PPT, either a decrease or an increase. Normalized data, transformed into mean unidirectional PPT differences, showed statistically highly significant changes after intervention. The relative risk of reacting with lowered PPTs on noxious stimulation was 3.7 times higher for subjects who had not given birth to children than for subjects who had given birth to 1 or several children (P\textbackslash{}textless.046). When 11 subjects were tested at a second session, a clear correlation of PPT reactions (r=0.527; P\textbackslash{}textless.001) was found. In summary, repetitive mechano-nociceptive stimulation of the trapezius muscle in healthy females evokes moderate and temporary changes in PPT that last for at least 35 minutes after cessation of stimulation. PERSPECTIVE A possible development of the response with transiently decreased PPTs into a model for human muscle pain is an intriguing possibility, since other models usually involve the introduction of chemical or thermal agents in the muscle, but this must await further research.},

DESIGN Prospective, psychophysical testing. SETTING An urban teaching hospital. SUBJECTS Twenty-five patients with fibromyalgia and 31 healthy controls (convenience sample). INTERVENTIONS Pressure pain threshold was determined at the 18 ACR tender points and five sham points using an algometer (dolorimeter). OUTCOME MEASURES The patients "algometric total scores" (sums of the patients' average pain thresholds at the 18 tender points) were derived, as well as pain thresholds across sham points. RESULTS The "algometric total score" could differentiate patients with fibromyalgia from normals with an accuracy of 85.7\% (P \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). Even a single tender point had a diagnostic accuracy between 75\% and 89\%. Although fibromyalgics had less pain across sham points than across ACR tender points, sham points also could be used for diagnosis (85.7\%; Ps \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that three points could be used for a classification accuracy equivalent to the use of all 18 points. CONCLUSIONS There was a significant difference in the "algometric total score" between patients with fibromyalgia and controls, and we suggest this quantified (although subjective) approach may represent a significant improvement over the current diagnostic scheme, but this must be tested vs other painful conditions. The points specified by the ACR were only modestly superior to sham points in making the diagnosis. Most importantly, this pilot suggests single points, smaller groups of points, or sham points may be as effective in diagnosing fibromyalgia as the use of all 18 points, and suggests methodologies to definitively test that hypothesis.},

BACKGROUND In the examination of patients with unilateral shoulder pain, pain provocation testing to compare the involved and uninvolved sides has been considered useful. However, side-to-side comparisons of experimental pain sensitivity in patients with unilateral shoulder pain are not widely reported in the literature. OBJECTIVES To compare experimental pain sensitivity between the involved and uninvolved sides in patients with unilateral shoulder pain. METHODS In consecutive patients seeking operative treatment for shoulder pain, sensitivity measures of bilateral pressure pain threshold at the shoulder and forearm, and thermal pain threshold, tolerance, and temporal summation at the forearm, were examined. Pressure sensitivity was tested with a Fischer pressure algometer, and thermal sensitivity with a computer-controlled Medoc neurosensory analyzer. The involved and uninvolved sides were compared with an analysis of variance. Influence of sex and location of testing were considered as covariates in the analysis. RESULTS Fifty-nine consecutively recruited participants completed experimental pain sensitivity testing. Participants reported significantly lower pressure pain thresholds in the involved side compared to the uninvolved side (F1,56 = 4.96, P = .030). In addition, female compared to male participants demonstrated lower pressure pain thresholds in the bilateral shoulder regions (F1,56 = 10.84, P = .002). There was no difference in thermal pain sensitivity between sides. Average clinical pain intensity was negatively correlated with pressure pain threshold at the involved local site (r = -0.284, P = .029), indicating an influence of clinical pain intensity on local pressure pain. CONCLUSION The results of this study provide evidence for higher experimental pressure pain sensitivity in the involved side of patients with unilateral shoulder pain and no difference between sides for thermal pain sensitivity. Females demonstrated higher pain sensitivity than males to pressure stimuli at the local shoulder region but not at the distal regions. Future studies should incorporate multiple stimuli when describing the pain profile of clinical populations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate interrater reliability using 5 newly trained observers in the assessment of pressure pain threshold (PPT) using a fixed-angle algometer. METHODS The study design comprised 2 phases. Phase 1: 5 undergraduate physical therapists were trained in algometry at a predefined angle, at a rate of 5 Newtons (N)/s, to the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Each observer then underwent a competency test of the application speed. The aim was to achieve repeated applications at 5 N/s without visual feedback from the algometer. Phase 2: the 5 observers measured PPT of 13 healthy volunteers, at the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The sequence of observer measurements for each participant was randomized. Mean PPT values for each observer were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1), and standard error of measurement, with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS No significant differences between observers' mean values were found (P=0.094), suggesting no bias. The ICC was 0.91 (95\% CI 0.82, 0.97). The standard error of measurement value was 6.27 N/cm (95\% CI 5.35, 7.59). Differences in PPT measurements of more than 17.39 N/cm (1.77 kg/cm) are likely to exceed the magnitude of measurement error, and could be used to indicate true change. This margin of error is, however, somewhat larger than a previously proposed minimum clinically important difference in PPT of 14.71 N/cm (1.5 kg/cm). DISCUSSION This study provides new evidence that trained observers can apply an algometer at a consistent rate and provide highly reliable measures of PPT in healthy humans, when PPT is calculated as the mean of 3 trials.},

  abstract = {Previous studies on pressure pain sensitivity in patients with migraine have shown conflicting results. There is emerging evidence suggesting that pain sensitivity is not uniformly distributed over the muscles, indicating the existence of topographical changes in pressure pain sensitivity. The aim of this study was to calculate topographical pressure pain sensitivity maps of the temporalis muscle in a blind design in patients with strictly unilateral migraine compared with controls. For this purpose, an electronic pressure algometer was used to measure pressure pain thresholds (PPT) over nine points of the temporalis muscle: three points in the anterior, medial and posterior parts, respectively. Pressure pain sensitivity maps of both sides (dominant or non-dominant; symptomatic or non-symptomatic) were calculated. The analysis of variance showed significant differences in PPT values between both groups (F = 279.2; P \textbackslash{}textless 0.001) and points (F = 4.033; P \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). Patients showed lower PPT at all nine points than healthy controls (P \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). We also found lower PPT in the centre of the muscle compared with the posterior part of the muscle within both groups (P \textbackslash{}textless 0.01). Interaction between group and points (F = 1.9; P \textbackslash{}textless 0.05) was also found. Within the migraine group, PPT levels were decreased bilaterally from the posterior to the anterior column of the temporalis muscle (Student-Newman- Keuls analysis; P \textbackslash{}textless 0.05), with the most sensitive in the anterior part of the muscle. For controls, PPT did not follow such anatomical distribution, the most sensitive point being the centre of the mid-muscle belly.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to construct a computerized deformation-controlled indentation system and compare its test-retest reliability, repeatability, and sensitivity with a manual algometer for pressure pain threshold (PPT) measurements. METHODS Pressure pain threshold measurements were made on 16 healthy subjects for 2 sessions on bilateral erector spinae muscles at L1, L3, and L5 spinal levels, consisting of 5 repeated trials each using computerized algometry on one side and manual algometry on the other side. Mean, SD, coefficient of variation, standard error of measurement, minimal detectable change, and intraclass correlation coefficient were calculated for both manual and computerized PPT measurements. Effects of session, level, method, and side on PPT measurements were evaluated using analysis of variance. RESULTS Manual PPT measurements were significantly larger than computerized PPT measurements (P = .017), and session 2 was significantly larger than session 1 (P = .021). Coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, standard error of measurement, and minimal detectable change of the manual and computerized PPT measurements were 10.3\%, 0.91, 0.19 kg/cm(2), and 0.54 kg/cm(2) and 15.6\%, 0.87, 0.26 kg/cm(2), and 0.73 kg/cm(2), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Although computerized algometry offers the benefits of eliminating the effects of operator reaction time, operator anticipation, alignment error, and variation in indentation rate on PPT measurements, these results indicate that manual algometry using load-controlled strategy may be better than computerized deformation-controlled algometry in terms of test-retest reliability, repeatability, and sensitivity. Constant load-controlled indentation protocol may be more favorable for PPT measurements. Future computerized instrumentation for PPT measurements should adopt a load-controlled mechanism.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The goal of present study was to examine the influence of demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and metabolic factors on pressure-induced pain threshold. DESIGN AND SETTING The study population comprised 2,517 healthy men at second-phase recruitment of a population-based cohort in China. The pressure pain threshold (PPT) at two locations, triceps and inguinal lines, was obtained using a digital pressure algometer. Education and occupation, as well as lifestyle factors, were self-reported in a face-to-face interview. Blood lipid and fasting glucose were measured as a routine healthy check-up program. RESULTS A lower PPT was found among men with younger age, higher level of education, and non-manual occupation. In addition, men with central obesity and moderate leisure time physical exercise were more sensitive to muscle mechanical stimuli. PPT was significantly correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({$\beta$} for triceps = 0.064, and {$\beta$} for inguinal lines = 0.052) in a multivariate linear regression model, after controlling for multiple variables. Elevated PPT was also found among subjects with hyperglycemia (both P for triceps and inguinal lines \textbackslash{}textless0.001) and excess drinking (P for triceps = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS It is important for physicians and researchers to consider these variables when evaluating pain sensitivity in clinic and in research. The underling mechanisms between these factors and pressure pain perception are worthy of further exploration.},

  abstract = {Pain localized in the deep tissues occurs frequently in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In addition, hyperalgesia to blunt pressure over muscles is common in CRPS, but it often appears in limb pain of other origin as well. Considering that 3-phase bone scintigraphy (TPBS) reveals periarticular enhanced bone metabolism in CRPS, joint-associated hyperalgesia to blunt pressure might be a more specific finding than hyperalgesia over muscles. In 34 patients with upper limb pain (18 CRPS, 16 non-CRPS; diagnosed in accordance to the Budapest criteria) and in 18 healthy controls, pressure-pain thresholds (PPT) were assessed bilaterally over the thenar (PPTThenar), the metacarpophalangeal (PPTMCP), and the proximal interphalangeal (PPTPIP) joints using a pressure algometer (Somedic, Sweden). Beforehand, all patients had received TPBS for diagnostic purposes independently of the study. Region-of-interest (ROI) ratios (mineralization phase) for the MCP and PIP, excluding fracture sites, were correlated with the PPT. In CRPS, all ROI ratios were significantly increased and all PPT of the affected hand were decreased compared to non-CRPS (PPTThenar: 243{$\pm$}150kPa vs 358{$\pm$}197kPa, PPTMCP: 80{$\pm$}67kPa vs 159{$\pm$}93kPa, PPTPIP: 80{$\pm$}56kPa vs 184{$\pm$}110kPa; P\textbackslash{}textless.01) and controls (PPTThenar: 478{$\pm$}106kPa, PPTMCP: 254{$\pm$}50kPa, PPTPIP: 275{$\pm$}76kPa; P\textbackslash{}textless.01). A PPTThenar below 293kPa revealed 77\% sensitivity but only 63\% specificity, whereas a PPTPIP below 102kPa had 82\% sensitivity and 94\% specificity to identify CRPS. Only in CRPS were PPTMCP and PPTPIP correlated significantly inversely with the ROI ratio (MCP: r=-0.439, PIP: r=-0.447). PPTPIP shows higher specificity for CRPS type I than PPTThenar without loss of sensitivity. Therefore, measurement of joint PPT could be a noninvasive diagnostic tool reflecting increased bone metabolism assessed by TPBS as a sign of bone pathophysiology.},

The aim of the current study was to compare pain pressure threshold levels using an algometer with a convex-formed contact piece and pressure increase rates similar to those in conventional finger palpation, making the conditions more like clinical examination of painful spots with commonly used physiotherapeutic methods. Healthy subjects, 12 male, mean age 22.5 +/- 1.62 (SD), and 12 female, 22.4 +/- 2.19 (SD), were enrolled. A transducer with a calibrated load range, 0 to 25 pounds, was used to measure pressure threshold levels for low (T1), VAS to approximately 2, and high (T2), VAS to approximately 8, pain levels bilaterally in the occipital (OC), sternocleidomastoid (SCM), upper trapezius (TU), transverse process of first vertebra (C1), and lateral temporomandibular joint (TMJ) areas. The null hypothesis was rejected. Levels T1 and T2 were significantly lower in the females in all tested areas. The range of the mean for T1 levels was 4.9-8.0 pounds for males and 3.2-5.1 pounds for females. For T2 levels, the range was 8.9-15.6 pounds for males and 6.2-10.3 pounds for females. Significant differences were found between muscle sites. These results support the use of different threshold levels: a) for males and females; and b) for different muscle areas.},

The purpose of this study was to assess peristaltic pulse dynamic compression (PPDC) in reducing short-term pressure-to-pain threshold (PPT) among Olympic Training Center athletes after morning training. Muscular tenderness and stiffness are common symptoms of fatigue and exercise-induced muscle microtrauma and edema. Twenty-four highly trained athletes (men = 12 and women = 12) volunteered to participate in this study. The athletes were randomly assigned to experimental (n = 12) and control (n = 12) groups. Pressure-to-pain threshold measurements were conducted with a manual algometer on 3 lower extremity muscles. Experimental group athletes underwent PPDC on both legs through computer-controlled circumferential inflated leggings that used a peristaltic-like pressure pattern from feet to groin. Pressures in each cell were set to factory defaults. Treatment time was 15 minutes. The control group performed the same procedures except that the inflation pump to the leggings was off. The experimental timeline included a morning training session, followed by a PPT pretest, treatment application (PPDC or control), an immediate post-test (PPT), and a delayed post-test (PPT) after the afternoon practice session. Difference score results showed that the experimental group's PPT threshold improved after PPDC treatment immediately and persisted the remainder of the day after afternoon practice. The control group showed no statistical change. We conclude that PPDC is a promising means of accelerating and enhancing recovery after the normal aggressive training that occurs in Olympic and aspiring Olympic athletes.},

In this research, we describe the application of an automatic pressure algometer with a linear increase in force. Ergonomically designed fixation devices were developed to increase the accuracy and to shorten the time of each measurement. Ten healthy volunteers were included in a pilot study to test the algometry method. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were investigated over 2 experimental days in three nonconsecutive runs at 29 measurement sites. During the experiment, subjects reported their subjective sleepiness, level of state-anxiety, psychological status and the perceived pain intensity of each measurement. Pain intensity ratings indicate that instructions were followed. State-anxiety and subjective sleepiness levels were low throughout the experiment. The method has proven to be suitable for standardized PPT measurements across the body in an ergonomic, safe, and user-friendly fashion.},

DESIGN This study is a cross-sectional study. A total of 40 patients (n = 20, HSP; n = 20, stroke without HSP) were enrolled in this study. PPTs were measured at the affected deltoid and the contralateral deltoid and the tibialis anterior using a handheld algometer. Differences in PPTs were analyzed by Wilcoxon's rank-sum test and with linear regression analysis, controlling for sex, a known confounder of PPTs. RESULTS The subjects with HSP had lower local PPTs than did the control subjects who have had a stroke when comparing the painful shoulders with the dominant shoulders of the controls and comparing the nonpainful shoulder and the tibialis anterior with the nondominant side of the controls. Similarly, those with HSP had lower PPTs compared with the controls in contralesional-to-contralesional comparisons as well as ipsilesional-to-ipsilesional comparisons. CONCLUSIONS The subjects with HSP have lower local and distal PPTs than the subjects without HSP. This study suggests that chronic shoulder pain may be associated with widespread central hypersensitivity, which has been previously found to be associated with other chronic pain syndromes. This further understanding can then help develop better treatment options for those with this HSP.},

The primary aim of this study was to determine the associations between muscle strength and PPT in adults with FM to test the hypothesis that greater measures of muscle strength would be associated with greater values of PPT. Secondary aims included determining the effects of pain severity and the peak uptake of oxygen (VO2) on the associations between muscle strength and PPT. METHODS Knee extensor and flexor strength (N = 69) was measured in the dominant leg using a dynamometer, and PPT was assessed using an electronic algometer. Pain severity was determined using the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, and peak VO2 uptake was quantified using an electronically braked cycle ergometer. RESULTS Univariable linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between PPT (dependent variable) and isometric knee extensor (P\textbackslash{}textless.001), isokinetic (60\textdegree/s) knee extensor (P = .002), and isokinetic (60\textdegree/s) knee flexor strength (P = .043). In a multiple variable linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, pain severity, body mass index and peak VO2 uptake, a significant association was found between PPT and isometric knee extensor strength (P = .008). In a similar multiple variable analysis, a significant association was found between PPT and isokinetic knee extensor strength (P = .044). CONCLUSION Greater measures of isometric and isokinetic knee extensor strength were significantly associated with greater values of PPT in both univariable and multiple variable linear regression models.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the number of tender points, pressure pain threshold and presence of fibromyalgia among women with or without dyspareunia. METHODS The present cross-sectional study included 40 patients with dyspareunia and 30 healthy controls. The participants were asked if they had engaged in sexual intercourse during the previous four weeks, and dyspareunia was rated from 0 to 3 based on the Marinoff Dyspareunia Scale. A pressure algometer (dolorimeter) was used to measure the pressure pain threshold. Fibromyalgia was diagnosed based on the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria. The depression status of the participants was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS No statistically significant difference was found with regard to age, body mass index, habits (alcohol use and smoking), educational status and occupational status between the two groups. Total myalgic score, total control score and tender point mean pain threshold were significantly lower in the group with dyspareunia. The number of tender points was significantly higher in patients with dyspareunia. The mean Beck Depression Inventory score was 14.7{$\pm$}8.4 in the dyspareunia group compared with 11.2{$\pm$}7.1 in the control group. Five (12.5\%) of the patients with dyspareunia were diagnosed with fibromyalgia, whereas no patients in the control group were diagnosed with fibromyalgia. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the presence of fibromyalgia. CONCLUSION The finding of lower pressure pain thresholds and a higher number of tender points among patients with dyspareunia suggests that these patients may have increased generalized pain thresholds. Additional studies involving a larger number of patients are required to investigate the presence of central mechanisms in the pathogenesis of dyspareunia.},

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the intratester repeatability of pressure algometer (Force-Five\textregistered{}) on the neck and shoulder area in women with neck pain. The study was cross-sectional with single-group repeated measurements. PPT measurements in 20 women with chronic non-specific neck pain were measured on consecutive days at the levator scapulae, at two points on the trapezius muscles on each side and at the sternum as the only non-muscular site. The intratester repeatability of the PPT measurements was satisfactory or good (Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 0.78-0.93). The coefficient of repeatability ranged from 16.8 to 24.4 N/cm2and the coefficient of variation ranged from 10\% to 22\%, depending on the site tested. Considerable individual variation was observed when consecutive measures were analysed against their mean. On the group level the repeatability of the measurements allows the pressure algometer to be used for research purposes. However, on the individual level, due to the considerable variation found in the PPT results, caution is advised when interpreting the results in clinical practice. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to assess pressure pain sensitivity topographical maps on the trapezius muscle in 20 patients with CTTH and 20 with unilateral migraine in comparison with 20 healthy controls in a blind design. For this purpose, a pressure algometer was used to assess pressure pain thresholds (PPT) over 11 points of the trapezius muscle: four points in the upper part of the muscle, two over the levator scapulae muscle, two in the middle part, and the remaining three points in the lower part of the muscle. Pressure pain sensitivity maps of both sides (dominant/non-dominant; symptomatic/non-symptomatic) were depicted for patients and controls. CTTH patients showed generalized lower PPT levels compared with both migraine patients (P = 0.03) and controls (P \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). The migraine group had also lower PPT than healthy controls (P \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). The most sensitive location for the assessment of PPT was the neck portion of the upper trapezius muscle in both patient groups and healthy controls (P \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). PPT was negatively related to some clinical pain features in both CTTH and unilateral migraine patients (all P \textbackslash{}textless 0.05). Side-to-side differences were found in strictly unilateral migraine, but not in those subjects with bilateral pain, i.e. CTTH. These data support the influence of muscle hyperalgesia in both CTTH and unilateral migraine patients and point towards a general pressure pain hyperalgesia of neck-shoulder muscles in headache patients, particularly in CTTH.},

OBJECTIVES: To describe the distribution of scores for pressure pain threshold (PPT) at 2 standardized testing sites in people with neck pain of less than 90 days' duration: the angle of the upper trapezius and the belly of the tibialis anterior. A secondary objective was to identify important influences on PPT. BACKGROUND: PPT may be a valuable assessment and prognostic indicator for people with neck pain. However, to facilitate interpretation of scores, knowledge of means and variance for the target population, as well as factors that might influence scores, is needed. METHODS: Participants were recruited from community-based physiotherapy clinics and underwent PPT testing using a digital algometer and standardized protocol. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviations, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis) were calculated for the 2 sites. Simple bivariate tests of association were conducted to explore potential moderators. RESULTS: A positively skewed distribution was described for the 2 standardized sites. Significant moderators were sex (male higher than female), age (r = 0.22), and self-reported pain intensity (r = -0.24). Neither litigation status nor most symptomatic/least symptomatic side influenced PPT. CONCLUSIONS: This manuscript presents information regarding the expected scores for PPT testing in people with acute or subacute neck pain. Clinicians can compare the results of individual patients against these population values, and researchers can incorporate the significant confounders of age, sex, and self-reported pain intensity into future research designs.},

A secondary objective was to identify important influences on PPT. BACKGROUND PPT may be a valuable assessment and prognostic indicator for people with neck pain. However, to facilitate interpretation of scores, knowledge of means and variance for the target population, as well as factors that might influence scores, is needed. METHODS Participants were recruited from community-based physiotherapy clinics and underwent PPT testing using a digital algometer and standardized protocol. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviations, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis) were calculated for the 2 sites. Simple bivariate tests of association were conducted to explore potential moderators. RESULTS A positively skewed distribution was described for the 2 standardized sites. Significant moderators were sex (male higher than female), age (r = 0.22), and self-reported pain intensity (r = -0.24). Neither litigation status nor most symptomatic/least symptomatic side influenced PPT. CONCLUSIONS This manuscript presents information regarding the expected scores for PPT testing in people with acute or subacute neck pain. Clinicians can compare the results of individual patients against these population values, and researchers can incorporate the significant confounders of age, sex, and self-reported pain intensity into future research designs.},

The participants were asked to answer a questionnaire with questions about TMD symptoms and neck or shoulder pain. They were also asked about preferred sleeping position as well as about perceived sleep quality. No differences could be found between the two groups in respect of sleeping position. However, significantly more individuals in the TMD group compared to the controls had changed their preferred sleeping position due to their face and/or jaw and/ or neck-shoulder symptoms. Subjects in the TMD group also more frequently stated that they often felt insufficiently rested at awakening and/or felt tired or sleepy in the daytime because of symptoms from face/jaws. A significant number in the control group reported TMD symptoms indicating a latent need for TMD treatment. It is concluded that sleep position seems to have little or no significance for the development or maintenance of TMD symptoms. However, the study indicates that TMD symptoms and associated neck- and shoulder pain affect the quality of sleep.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Associations between temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and psychological variables, pain conditions, and daily activities have been reported more commonly in middle-aged individuals than in children. However, to determine factor-specific preventive programs for TMD, it is important to evaluate the associations between multiple factors and TMD symptoms during childhood. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between TMD symptoms and other orofacial pain conditions, daily activities, and trait anxiety in a population-based cross-sectional survey of Japanese children and adolescents. METHODS A total of 1,415 subjects (11-15 years old) self-reported their TMD symptoms, headache, neck pain, and toothache, and completed questionnaire scales that assessed 15 daily activities. Trait anxiety was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children-Trait (STAIC-T) scale. Subjects were dichotomized into a TMD group or control group, based on whether they reported at least 1 TMD symptom: the TMD group ({$\geq$}1 TMD symptom, n = 182) and the control group (no TMD symptoms, n = 1,233). Data were analyzed using the chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The prevalence rates for headache and neck pain were significantly higher in the TMD group than in the control group (44.0\% vs. 24.7\% and 54.4\% vs. 30.0\%, respectively; both P \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). The odds ratios for TMD symptoms in subjects with neck pain and frequent diurnal clenching were 2.08 (P \textbackslash{}textless 0.001) and 3.69 (P = 0.011), respectively. Moreover, high STAIC-T scores were weakly associated with TMD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS In this young Japanese population, TMD symptoms were associated with other orofacial pain conditions, particularly neck pain, although they were only weakly associated with trait anxiety. Diurnal clenching was strongly associated with TMD symptoms. Health professionals should carefully consider these factors when developing appropriate management strategies for TMD in children and adolescents.},

  abstract = {, DC, FCCS(C), MSc Study Design. Potential precipitating events and risk factors for vertebrobasilar artery dissection were re-viewed in an analysis of the English language literature published before 1993. Objectives. To assess the literature pertaining to pre-cipitating neck movements and risk factors for vertebro-basilar artery dissection in an attempt to determine whether the incidence of these complications can be min-imized. Summary of Background Data. Vertebrobasilar artery dissection and occlusion leading to brain stem and cere-bellar ischemia and infarction are rare but often devastat-ing complications of cervical manipulation and neck trauma. Although various investigators have suggested potential risk factors and precipitating events, the basis for these suggestions remains unclear. Methods. A detailed search of the literature using three computerized bibliographic databases was per-formed to identify English language articles from 1966 to 1993. Literature before 1966 was identified through a hand search of Index Medicus. References of articles ob-tained by database search were reviewed to identify ad-ditional relevant articles. Data presented in all articles meeting the inclusion criteria were summarized. Results. The 367 case reports included in this study describe 160 cases of spontaneous onset, 115 cases of onset after spinal manipulation, 58 cases associated with trivial trauma, and 37 cases caused by major trauma (3 cases were classified in two categories). The nature of the precipitating trauma, neck movement, or type of manip-ulation that was performed was poorly defined in the literature, and it was not possible to identify a specific neck movement or trauma that would be considered the offending activity in the majority of cases. There were 208 (57\%) men and 158 (43\%) women (gender data not re-ported in one case) with an average age of 39.3 6 12.9 years. There was an overall prevalence of 13.4\% hyper-tension, 6.5\% migraines, 18\% use of oral contraception (percent of female patients), and 4.9\% smoking. In only isolated cases was specific vascular disease such as fibro-muscular hyperplasia noted. Conclusions. The literature does not assist in the iden-tification of the offending mechanical trauma, neck move-ment, or type of manipulation precipitating vertebrobasi-lar artery dissection or the identification of the patient at risk. Thus, given the current status of the literature, it is impossible to advise patients or physicians about how to avoid vertebrobasilar artery dissection when considering cervical manipulation or about specific sports or exer-cises that result in neck movement or trauma.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Strokes, typically involving vertebral artery dissection, can follow cervical spinal manipulative therapy, and these types of stroke occur rarely. There is disagreement about whether a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke exists. An earlier systematic review found two relevant studies of association that used controls, which also discussed the limitations of the two papers. Our systematic review updates the earlier review, and aims to determine whether conclusive evidence of a strong association exists. METHODS PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed, and the literature was searched using a strategy that included the terms 'neck manipulation' and 'stroke' from the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus and AMED databases. Citations were included if they met criteria such as being case-control studies, and dealt with neck manipulation and/or neck movement/positioning. Papers were scored for their quality, using similar criteria to the earlier review. For individual criteria, each study was assigned a full positive score if the criterion was satisfied completely. RESULTS Four case-control studies and one case-control study, which included a case- crossover design, met the selection criteria, but all of them had at least three items in the quality assessment that failed to be completely positive. Two studies were assessed to be the most robustly designed, one indicating a strong association between stroke and various intensities of neck movement, including manipulation, and the other suggesting a much reduced relative association when using primary care practitioners' visits as controls. However, potential biases and confounders render the results inconclusive. CONCLUSION Conclusive evidence is lacking for a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, but is also absent for no association. Future studies of association will need to minimise potential biases and confounders, and ideally have sufficient numbers of cases to allow subgroup analysis for different types of neck manipulation and neck movement.},

Methodological quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) appraisal tools.\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$n\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nRESULTS: Fourteen papers including 3957 participants, 1006 people with and 2951 controls without BJHS were eligible. The overall methodological quality was moderate. The results indicated that people with BJHS experience significantly greater perceptions of fear and more intense fear (P \textbackslash{}textless 0.05) and have a higher probability of demonstrating agoraphobia (P \textbackslash{}textless 0.05), anxiety (OR 4.39, 95\% CI 1.92, 10.40), depression (OR 4.10, 95\% CI 1.79, 9.41) and panic disorders (OR 6.72, 95\% CI 2.22, 20.35) than those without BJHS (P {$\leq$} 0.005). Neither anxiety nor depression have been assessed in childhood populations.\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$n\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nCONCLUSION: People with BJHS commonly exhibit a range of symptoms related to anxiety and depression. Considerable emotional symptoms accompany BJHS. Further study is warranted to explore how these results relate to non-Mediterranean populations and children. However, the data suggest that targeting psychological symptoms could be an important approach to managing the range of symptoms reported in these patients.},

Methods: Twenty-one subjects with chronic postural neck pain performed 3 submaximal muscle tests twice on the first occasion and once at the second session 3 days later. The tests examined isometric neck flexion, neck extension, and scapular muscle endurance. Results: Reliability was excellent for the neck flexor test (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0 93), moderate for the scapular test (ICC = 0.67), and good for the neck extensor test (ICC = 0 88). The standard error of measure for the tests was 6.4, 10.9, and 25.9 seconds, respectively. The minimum change required to represent real change in muscle endurance was 17.8 seconds for the neck flexor test, 30.1 seconds for the scapular test, and 71.3 seconds for the neck extensor test.

  abstract = {Joint proprioceptive deficit is documented in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions including osteoarthritis, ligament and meniscal injuries, and individuals with increased joint hypermobility, such as those with Ehlers-Danlos. No systematic reviews have assessed joint proprioception in people with benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS). This study addresses this to determine whether people with BJHS exhibit reduced joint proprioception, and, if so, whether this is evident in all age groups. The search strategy was conducted on 31st January 2013. The published literature was assessed using the databases: AMED, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Unpublished literature and trial registries were assessed including: OpenGrey, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Current Controlled Trials, the UK National Research Register Archive. All studies comparing the proprioceptive capability of people with and without BJHS were included. Study methodological quality was assessed using the CASP appraisal tool. Meta-analysis techniques were used when study homogeneity permitted. Five studies including 254 people were identified. People with BJHS demonstrated statistically significantly poorer lower limb joint position sense (JPS) (p \textbackslash{}textless 0.001) and threshold detection to movement (p \textbackslash{}textless 0.001) than those without BJHS. The evidence for upper limb proprioceptive difference was less clear, with no statistically significant difference between the cohorts for shoulder JPS (p = 0.10), but a statistically significant difference in finger JPS (p \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). One study which assessed childhood BJHS reported reduced knee proprioceptive capability in those with BJHS (p \textbackslash{}textless 0.001). To conclude, lower limb joint proprioception is reduced in those with BJHS compared to non-BJHS cohorts, whilst unclear in the upper limb.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinicians frequently rely on subjective categorization of impairments in mobility, strength, and endurance for clinical decision-making; however, these assessments are often unreliable and lack sensitivity to change. The objective of this study was to determine the inter-rater reliability, minimum detectable change (MDC), and group differences in quantitative cervicothoracic measures for individuals with and without chronic neck pain (NP).\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$n\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nMETHODS: Nineteen individuals with NP and 20 healthy controls participated in this case control study. Two physical therapists performed a 30-minute examination on separate days. A handheld dynamometer, gravity inclinometer, ruler, and stopwatch were used to quantify cervical range of motion (ROM), cervical muscle strength and endurance, and scapulothoracic muscle length and strength, respectively.\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$n\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nRESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients for inter-rater reliability were significantly greater than zero for most impairment measures, with point estimates ranging from 0.45 to 0.93. The NP group exhibited reduced cervical ROM (P {$\leq$} 0.012) and muscle strength (P {$\leq$} 0.038) in most movement directions, reduced cervical extensor endurance (P = 0.029), and reduced rhomboid and middle trapezius muscle strength (P {$\leq$} 0.049).\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$n\$\textbackslash{}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining objective cervicothoracic impairment measures with acceptable inter-rater agreement across time. The clinical utility of these measures is supported by evidence of impaired mobility, strength, and endurance among patients with NP, with corresponding MDC values that can help establish benchmarks for clinically significant change.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Rugby league is a collision sport where musculoskeletal injuries are common. There has been little research on generalised joint hypermobility (GJH) as a risk factor for injury in rugby league. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of GJH on the incidence of injuries in first and second team rugby league players from one British university. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of 45 student players from one British university first and second team rugby league squads (mean age 20.93{$\pm$}1.57 years). At the beginning of the season, GJH was determined using a 9-point Beighton scale, and injury and exposure data were collected on a weekly basis throughout the 2013-2014 season. RESULTS The prevalence of GJH was 20\%. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of injuries between GJH and non-GJH participants (p=0.938, Mann-Whitney U test).Participants categorised as having GJH did not experience a higher fequency of injury (p=0.722, Fisher's exact test) and there was no tendency to demonstrate a higher risk of injury for participants categorised as GJH (OR=0.64, 95\% CI 0.15 to 2.78; relative risk (RR)=1.188, 95\% CI 0.537 to 2.625). The most common site of injury was the ankle, but this was not statistically significant (OR=0.152, 95\% CI 0.008 to 2.876; RR=0.195, CI 0.012 to 3.066). CONCLUSION British university rugby league players with GJH did not demonstrate a greater risk of injury than those without GJH.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE The primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether a single session of spinal manipulation (SM) increases strength and cortical drive in the lower limb (soleus muscle) of elite Taekwondo athletes. METHODS Soleus-evoked V-waves, H-reflex and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the plantar flexors were recorded from 11 elite Taekwondo athletes using a randomized controlled crossover design. Interventions were either SM or passive movement control. Outcomes were assessed at pre-intervention and at three post-intervention time periods (immediate post, post 30 min and post 60 min). A multifactorial repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to assess within and between group differences. Time and session were used as factors. A post hoc analysis was carried out, when an interactive effect was present. Significance was set at p {$\leq$} 0.05. RESULTS SM increased MVC force [F(3,30) = 5.95, p \textbackslash{}textless 0.01], and V-waves [F(3,30) = 4.25, p = 0.01] over time compared to the control intervention. Between group differences were significant for all time periods (p \textbackslash{}textless 0.05) except for the post60 force measurements (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION A single session of SM increased muscle strength and corticospinal excitability to ankle plantar flexor muscles in elite Taekwondo athletes. The increased MVC force lasted for 30 min and the corticospinal excitability increase persisted for at least 60 min.},

METHODS For this study, 24 asymptomatic male recreational right-handed basketball players (age = 26.3 {$\pm$} 9.2 years, height = 1.81 {$\pm$} 0.07 m, body mass = 82.6 {$\pm$} 10.4 kg [mean {$\pm$} SD]) underwent baseline dominant handgrip isometric strength and free-throw accuracy testing in an indoor basketball court. They were then equally randomized to receive either (1) diversified left lower cervical spine chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT) at C5/C6 or (2) placebo CMT at C5/C6 using an Activator adjusting instrument on zero force setting. Participants then underwent posttesting of isometric handgrip strength and free-throw accuracy. A paired-samples t test was used to make within-group pre to post comparisons and between-group pre to post comparisons. RESULTS No statistically significant difference was shown between either of the 2 basketball performance variables measured in either group. Isometric handgrip strength marginally improved by 0.7 kg (mean) in the CMT group (P = .710). Free-throw accuracy increased by 13.2\% in the CMT group (P = .058). The placebo CMT group performed the same or more poorly during their second test session. CONCLUSIONS The results of this preliminary study showed that a single lower cervical spine manipulation did not significantly impact basketball performance for this group of healthy asymptomatic participants. A slight increase in free-throw percentage was seen, which deserves further investigation. This pilot study demonstrates that a larger study to evaluate if CMT affects handgrip strength and free-throw accuracy is feasible.},

CLINICAL FEATURES A 42-year-old female patient sought care for left shoulder pain with a secondary complaint of left lower neck pain. Twelve days prior, she had had "the worst headache of her life," which began in her left lower cervical spine and extended to her left temporal region. The pain was sudden and severe, was described as sharp and burning, and lasted 3 hours. She reported nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME Initial history and examination suggested that the patient's head and neck pain was not musculoskeletal in origin, but vascular. She repeatedly requested that an adjustment be performed, but instead was referred to the local emergency department for further evaluation. Magnetic resonance angiogram revealed a dissection of the left vertebral artery from C6 to the C2-C3 interspace and a 3-mm dissecting pseudoaneurysm at the C3 level. She underwent stent-assisted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty combined with antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel) and experienced a good outcome.

  abstract = {, DC, FCCS(C), MSc Study Design. Potential precipitating events and risk factors for vertebrobasilar artery dissection were re-viewed in an analysis of the English language literature published before 1993. Objectives. To assess the literature pertaining to pre-cipitating neck movements and risk factors for vertebro-basilar artery dissection in an attempt to determine whether the incidence of these complications can be min-imized. Summary of Background Data. Vertebrobasilar artery dissection and occlusion leading to brain stem and cere-bellar ischemia and infarction are rare but often devastat-ing complications of cervical manipulation and neck trauma. Although various investigators have suggested potential risk factors and precipitating events, the basis for these suggestions remains unclear. Methods. A detailed search of the literature using three computerized bibliographic databases was per-formed to identify English language articles from 1966 to 1993. Literature before 1966 was identified through a hand search of Index Medicus. References of articles ob-tained by database search were reviewed to identify ad-ditional relevant articles. Data presented in all articles meeting the inclusion criteria were summarized. Results. The 367 case reports included in this study describe 160 cases of spontaneous onset, 115 cases of onset after spinal manipulation, 58 cases associated with trivial trauma, and 37 cases caused by major trauma (3 cases were classified in two categories). The nature of the precipitating trauma, neck movement, or type of manip-ulation that was performed was poorly defined in the literature, and it was not possible to identify a specific neck movement or trauma that would be considered the offending activity in the majority of cases. There were 208 (57\%) men and 158 (43\%) women (gender data not re-ported in one case) with an average age of 39.3 6 12.9 years. There was an overall prevalence of 13.4\% hyper-tension, 6.5\% migraines, 18\% use of oral contraception (percent of female patients), and 4.9\% smoking. In only isolated cases was specific vascular disease such as fibro-muscular hyperplasia noted. Conclusions. The literature does not assist in the iden-tification of the offending mechanical trauma, neck move-ment, or type of manipulation precipitating vertebrobasi-lar artery dissection or the identification of the patient at risk. Thus, given the current status of the literature, it is impossible to advise patients or physicians about how to avoid vertebrobasilar artery dissection when considering cervical manipulation or about specific sports or exer-cises that result in neck movement or trauma.

  abstract = {Objective. To undertake a best evidence synthesis of the published evidence on the burden and determinants of neck pain and its associated disorders in the general population. Summary of Background Data. The evidence on burden and determinants of neck has not previously been summarized.
Methods. The Bone and Joint Decade 2000 \textendash{}2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders performed a systematic search and critical review of literature published between 1980 and 2006 to assemble the best evidence on neck pain. Studies meeting criteria for scientific validity were included in a best evidence synthesis.
Results. We identified 469 studies on burden and determinants of neck pain, and judged 249 to be scientifically admissible; 101 articles related to the burden and determinants of neck pain in the general population. Incidence ranged from 0.055 per 1000 person years (disc herniation with radiculopathy) to 213 per 1000 persons (self-reported neck pain). Incidence of neck injuries during competitive sports ranged from 0.02 to 21 per 1000 exposures. The 12-month prevalence of pain typically ranged between 30\% and 50\%; the 12-month prevalence of activity-limiting pain was 1.7\% to 11.5\%. Neck pain was more prevalent among women and prevalence peaked in middle age. Risk factors for neck pain included genetics, poor psychological health, and exposure to tobacco. Disc degeneration was not identified as a risk factor. The use of sporting gear (helmets, face shields) to prevent other types of injury was not associated with increased neck injuries in bicycling, hockey, or skiing.
Conclusion. Neck pain is common. Nonmodifiable risk factors for neck pain included age, gender, and genetics. Modifiable factors included smoking, exposure to tobacco, and psychological health. Disc degeneration was not identified as a risk factor. Future research should concentrate on longitudinal designs exploring preventive strategies and modifiable risk factors for neck pain.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and best evidence synthesis.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and incidence of neck pain and disability in workers; to identify risk factors for neck pain in workers; to propose an etiological diagram; and to make recommendations for future research.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous reviews of the etiology of neck pain in workers relied on cross-sectional evidence. Recently published cohorts and randomized trials warrant a re-analysis of this body of research.
METHODS: We systematically searched Medline for literature published from 1980-2006. Retrieved articles were reviewed for relevance. Relevant articles were critically appraised. Articles judged to have adequate internal validity were included in our best evidence synthesis.
RESULTS: One hundred and nine papers on the burden and determinants of neck pain in workers were scientifically admissible. The annual prevalence of neck pain varied from 27.1\% in Norway to 47.8\% in Qu\'ebec, Canada. Each year, between 11\% and 14.1\% of workers were limited in their activities because of neck pain. Risk factors associated with neck pain in workers include age, previous musculoskeletal pain, high quantitative job demands, low social support at work, job insecurity, low physical capacity, poor computer workstation design and work posture, sedentary work position, repetitive work and precision work. We found preliminary evidence that gender, occupation, headaches, emotional problems, smoking, poor job satisfaction, awkward work postures, poor physical work environment, and workers' ethnicity may be associated with neck pain. There is evidence that interventions aimed at modifying workstations and worker posture are not effective in reducing the incidence of neck pain in workers.
CONCLUSION: Neck disorders are a significant source of pain and activity limitations in workers. Most neck pain results from complex relationships between individual and workplace risk factors. No prevention strategies have been shown to reduce the incidence of neck pain in workers.},

  abstract = {Objective Neck pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder, but little is known about which individuals develop neck pain. This systematic review investigated factors that constitute a risk for the onset of non-specific neck pain.
Design and setting A range of electronic databases and reference sections of relevant articles were searched to identify appropriate articles. Studies investigating risk factors for the onset of non-specific neck pain in asymptomatic populations were included. All studies were prospective with at least 1 year follow-up.
Main results 14 independent cohort studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Thirteen studies were assessed as high quality. Female gender, older age, high job demands, low social/work support, being an ex-smoker, a history of low back disorders and a history of neck disorders were linked to the development of non-specific neck pain.
Conclusions Various clinical and sociodemographic risk factors were identified that have implications for occupational health and health policy. However, there was a lack of good-quality research investigating the predictive nature of many other variables.},

  abstract = {Fundamento y objetivo
El dolor dorsal (DD) y el dolor cervical (DC) cr\'onicos son muy prevalentes en la poblaci\'on adulta. Sin embargo, poco se sabe respecto de su comorbilidad con otros procesos y su impacto sobre el funcionamiento global del individuo. El siguiente trabajo, que forma parte del estudio ESEMeD-Espa\~na, tiene por objetivos estimar la prevalencia del DD-DC cr\'onico en la poblaci\'on espa\~nola, su comorbilidad con otras enfermedades y trastornos f\'isicos y mentales, adem\'as de su impacto sobre el funcionamiento global.
Sujetos y m\'etodo
Se realiz\'o una encuesta personal domiciliaria a una muestra representativa de la poblaci\'on espa\~nola mayor de 18 a\~nos compuesta por 5.473 individuos. Los entrevistados informaron de la presencia de DD-DC cr\'onico y las enfermedades y trastornos com\'orbidos. Los trastornos mentales se evaluaron con la Composite International Diagnostic Interview y el funcionamiento global con la WHO Dissability Assessment Schedule. La tasa de respuesta fue del 78,6\%.
Resultados
El DD-DC cr\'onico present\'o una prevalencia-a\~no del 14,7\%. Un 65,7\% de las personas que lo presentaban refiri\'o al menos una enfermedad/trastorno com\'orbido, ya fuesen otras enfermedades que implicaban dolor cr\'onico (49,4\%), enfermedades f\'isicas cr\'onicas (40,7\%), alg\'un trastorno del estado de \'animo (7,9\%), trastorno de angustia (1,3\%), trastorno por estr\'es postraum\'atico (1,5\%) o ansiedad generalizada (1,4\%). Adem\'as, el DD-DC cr\'onico mostr\'o un impacto negativo sobre el funcionamiento global. Sin embargo, las enfermedades y trastornos com\'orbidos explicaron casi un tercio de la asociaci\'on entre DD-DC y funcionamiento global.
Conclusiones
El DD-DC cr\'onico presenta una elevada prevalencia y comorbilidad con otras enfermedades y trastornos f\'isicos y mentales. Esta comorbilidad afecta negativamente al funcionamiento global de los individuos.
Background and objective
Chronic back pain (CBP) and chronic neck pain (CNP) are highly prevalent among the adult population. However, less is known about its comorbidity with other diseases and its impact on global functioning. The objectives of following study, that is part of the ESEMeD-Spain study, are to estimate CBP-CNP prevalence among Spanish population, its comorbidity with other physical and mental conditions, and its impact on global functioning.
Subjects and method
Cross-sectional household survey of a representative sample of the population of Spain 18 years or older. Sample size was 5,473 individuals. CBP-CNP and comorbid conditions were ascertained by self-report. Mental disorders were ascertained with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and global functioning with the WHO Dissability Assessment Schedule. Response rate was 78.6\%.
Results
The one year prevalence of chronic CBP-CNP was 14.7\%. A 65.7\% of people with CBP-CNP reported at least one other comorbid condition, including other chronic pain conditions (49.4\%), chronic physical conditions (40.7\%), any mood disorders (7.9\%), panic disorder (1.3\%), posttraumatic stress disorder (1.5\%) or generalized anxiety disorder (1.4\%). Additionally, CBP-CNP negatively affected global functioning. However, comorbid conditions explained about one-third of the association between CBP-CNP and global functioning.
Conclusions
CBP-CNP is highly prevalent and comorbid with other physical and mental conditions. Comorbidity negatively affects individuals global functioning.},

  abstract = {Method: Fifty-five patients with erosive hand osteoarthritis (EHOA) and 21 patients with nodal hand osteoarthritis (NOA) fulfilling American College of Rheumatology criteria for HOA were evaluated. Subjects showing at least two erosions of the interphalangeal joints were assigned to the EHOA group; the others were considered NOA. Disease duration, number of active joints and radiological scores were assessed. All patients and 174 controls underwent phalangeal radiographic absorptiometry (pRA) of the middle phalanges of the non-dominant hand to assess BMD, T- and Z-scores.
Results: BMD was higher in EHOA with respect to NOA and controls (P = 0.05); T- and Z-scores were significantly higher in EHOA (P = 0.01 and P {$<$} 0.01). Values suggestive of osteopenia were found in 32\% of EHOA and 22\% of NOA patients, and in 44\% of controls (P = 0.05 EHOA vs. NOA); a T-score {$<$} \`A2.5 standard deviations was present in 15\% of EHOA and 28\% of NOA patients, and in 21\% of controls (P = 0.05 EHOA vs. NOA).
Conclusion: Phalangeal BMD was higher in EHOA compared to NOA and controls. This characteristic could potentially be exploited to differentiate the two hand OA subtypes.},

  abstract = {Objectives: This study aims to examine the relationship between primary generalized osteoarthritis (OA) and bone mineral density (BMD) and to investigate whether OA patients have a higher BMD value than healthy individuals. Patients and methods: The study population consisted of 80 postmenopausal female patients (mean age 58.95{$\pm$}4.63 years) who suffered from hand OA with Heberden's nodes, while the control group consisted of 80 postmenopausal female patients (mean age 57.62{$\pm$}5.39) without symptomatic OA and Heberden's nodes. The patients were age-matched. Blood biochemistry, thyroid function tests and bone turnover markers (serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and urine deoxypyridinoline) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] levels of the participants were measured. A comparison was made between the two groups with regard to BMD levels, lateral thoracolumbar X-rays, and anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis, knees, and hands. The evaluation of the radiographs was based on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale. The lumbar and femoral BMD levels in both groups were measured in g/cm2 with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
Results: The 25(OH)D3 value of the OA group was significantly higher than the control group, indicating a statistically significant difference. The lumbar spine BMD levels were statistically higher in the control group compared with the OA group, however, there were no significant differences in the hip BMD values and lumbar spine T scores between the groups.
Conclusion: Our study results suggest that primary generalized OA is not protective against osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {The relationship between osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP), the two most common skeletal disorders related to aging, is controversial. Previous studies suggest that OA is inversely related to OP when studied cross-sectionally and systematically. However, there are differences in the results depending on the parameter used to define OA. The purpose of this review is to analyze and summarize the literature, and derive possible answers to three key questions along with a brief introduction on underlying mechanisms: (1) Is OA correlated to a high bone mineral density (BMD)? (2) Does OA influence the progression of OP or osteoporotic fractures? (3) Does high BMD affect the incidence and progression of OA? A review of the literature suggests that OA is inversely related to OP in general when studied cross-sectionally and systematically. However, when analyzed in individual bones, the BMD of the appendicular skeleton in OA-affected joints may decrease, particularly in the upper extremities. On whether OA influences bone loss or osteoporotic fractures, differences are observed according to the affected joints. The risk for osteoporotic fracture does not seem to decrease despite a high BMD in patients with OA, probably due to postural instability and muscle strength. Low BMD at the lumbar spine is associated with a lower incidence of knee OA although it does not arrest the progression of knee OA.},

Dr. Alf Breig was the Leonardo da Vinci of biomechanics of the nervous system. He made the biggest and most significant contribution ever to our understanding of how the nervous system functions mechanically. He did this through his photographic documentations of fresh cadavers, patient investigations and photelastic modelling of force behaviour, to name just a few of his techniques. He originated the concept of adverse mechanical tension in the nervous system, from which came new concepts in manual and musculoskeletal medicine. These included adverse neural tension and neural mobilisation which ultimately gave way to clinical neurodynamics. Many clinicians in the area of musculoskeltal medicine have heard of Breig, although, not many have actually seen his work. The contents of this book include: Work from Dr. Alf breig's first two books "Biomechanics of the Central Nervous System (1960) and "Adverse Mechanical Tension in the Nervous System (1978)" Photoelastic models of stress behaviour in n the human nervous system Cranial nerve and nerve root movment Spinal cord biomechanics with spinal movements Movement of the meningeal tissues and intraneural blood vessel behaviour Cauda equina biomechanics Sliding and tension behaviour of the neural tissues Pressure biofeedback analysis of lumbopelvic movement with neurobiodynamic testing. In order to bring Breig's work back to life, NDS Neurodynamic Solutions and the Orthopadeic Manual Therapy Division of the Swedish Physiotherapists' Association proudly present his classic work between the 1950s and 1970s in pictorial and graphic detail for the first time since this work was released over 40 years ago.},

  abstract = {Background
The prevalence of neuropathic pain (NeP) has been estimated within specific health conditions; however, there are no published data on its broad prevalence in the US. The current exploratory study addresses this gap using the validated PainDetect questionnaire as a screener for probable NeP in a general-population health survey conducted with a multimodal recruitment strategy to maximize demographic representativeness.

Materials and methods
Adult respondents were recruited from a combination of Internet panels, telephone lists, address lists, mall-based interviews, and store-receipt invitations using a random stratified-sampling framework, with strata defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Older persons and minorities were oversampled to improve prevalence estimates. Results were weighted to match the total adult US population using US Census data. Demographic information was collected, and respondents who experienced physical pain in the past 12 months completed the PainDetect and provided additional pain history. A cutoff score of 19 or greater on the PainDetect was used to define probable NeP.

Results
A total of 24,925 respondents (average response rate 2.5\%) provided demographic data (52.2\% female, mean age 51.5 years); 15,751 respondents reported pain (63.7\%), of which 2,548 (15.7\%, 95\% confidence interval 14.9\%\textendash{}16.5\%) had probable NeP based on the PainDetect, which was 10\% (95\% confidence interval 9.5\%\textendash{}10.5\%) of all respondents. Among those reporting pain, the prevalence of probable NeP among Blacks and Hispanics was consistently higher than Whites in each age- and sex group. The highest prevalence among those with pain was among male Hispanics 35\textendash{}44 years (32.4\%) and 45\textendash{}54 years (24.2\%) old. The most commonly used medications reported by those with probable NeP were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (44.2\%), followed by weak opioids (31.7\%), antiepileptics (10.9\%), and strong opioids (10.9\%).

Conclusion
This is the first study to provide an estimate of the prevalence of probable NeP in the US, showing significant variation by age and ethnicity.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to develop a simple and reproducible self-reporting questionnaire that identifies individuals with hypermobility. Two hundred and twelve consecutive hypermobile female new attendees to the hypermobility clinic at two London teaching hospitals and a random selection of 57 healthy volunteers completed a 10-part questionnaire. Questions were selected from clinical experience (RG), and assessed musculoskeletal symptoms and past and present physical agility. Of the 212 cases, 30 were hypermobile with no other underlying disorder and 182 fulfilled the 1998 Brighton criteria for benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS). Odds ratios for the presence of hypermobility were calculated for each question. Six questions were found to be significant and the model of 'best fit' for sensitivity and specificity contained five of these. To demonstrate the reproducibility of the five-part questionnaire a second cohort of 170 hypermobile cases with BJHS and 50 controls was surveyed. Analysis demonstrated that a positive answer to any two questions in the five-part questionnaire gave the highest combined sensitivity and specificity for detecting hypermobility. The sensitivity and specificity was 84\% and 89\% respectively in the first cohort and reproduced with values of 84\% and 80\% in the second cohort. Overall the questionnaire correctly identified 84\% of all cases and controls. This simple and reproducible questionnaire for detecting hypermobility could be of particular use as an adjunct in the clinical assessment of chronic, diffuse pain syndromes where hypermobility is often missed yet is potentially treatable.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Anxiety disorders may be associated with several non-psychiatric disorders. Current literature has been investigating the association between anxiety and joint hypermobility (JHM), with special interest in non-articular symptoms that may be related to autonomic dysfunction. This study investigated the association between anxiety and JHM in a sample of Brazilian university students.
METHODS: Data were cross-sectionally collected in two Brazilian universities (N=2600). Participants completed three validated self-rating anxiety scales: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) and the brief-version of SPIN (Mini-SPIN). They also answered the self-rating screening questionnaire for JHM: the Five-part Questionnaire for Identifying Hypermobility.
RESULTS: Hypermobile women showed significantly higher scores in all the anxiety scales, when compared with men: BAI total score (t=3.77; p{$<$}0.001), its four subscales, SPIN score (t=2.71; p{$<$}0.007) and Mini-SPIN (t=2.58; p{$<$}0.01). Among BAI subscales, the autonomic subscale was shown to be more significantly (t=3.89; p{$<$}0.001) associated with joint hypermobility in women.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study support earlier evidence on the relationship between anxiety and JHM in women, showing specific gender-related features in this field. It also directs attention to non-articular symptoms that may be enrolled in this association.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) has repeatedly been associated with anxiety and anxiety disorders, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and temporomandibular joint disorder. However, the neural underpinnings of these associations still remain unclear. This study explored brain responses to facial visual stimuli with emotional cues using fMRI techniques in general population with different ranges of hypermobility.
METHODS: Fifty-one non-clinical volunteers (33 women) completed state and trait anxiety questionnaire measures, were assessed with a clinical examination for hypermobility (Beighton system) and performed an emotional face processing paradigm during functional neuroimaging.
RESULTS: Trait anxiety scores did significantly correlate with both state anxiety and hypermobility scores. BOLD signals of the hippocampus did positively correlate with hypermobility scores for the crying faces versus neutral faces contrast in ROI analyses. No results were found for any of the other studied ROIs. Additionally, hypermobility scores were also associated with other key affective processing areas (i.e. the middle and anterior cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal region, orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum) in the whole brain analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypermobility scores are associated with trait anxiety and higher brain responses to emotional faces in emotion processing brain areas (including hippocampus) described to be linked to anxiety and somatic symptoms. These findings increase our understanding of emotion processing in people bearing this heritable variant of collagen and the mechanisms through which vulnerability to anxiety and somatic symptoms arises in this population.},

Most published articles dealt with the link between gJHM (or JHS/EDS-HT) and anxiety-related conditions, and a novel generation of studies is emerging aimed at investigating the psychopathologic background of such an association. In this paper, literature review was carried out with a semi-systematic approach spanning the entire spectrum of psychopathological findings in gJHM and JHS/EDS-HT. Interestingly, in addition to the confirmation of a tight link between anxiety and gJHM, preliminary connections with depression, attention deficit (and hyperactivity) disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder were also found. Few papers investigated the relationship with schizophrenia with contrasting results. The mind-body connections hypothesized on the basis of available data were discussed with focus on somatotype, presumed psychopathology, and involvement of the extracellular matrix in the central nervous system. The hypothesis of positive Beighton score and alteration of interoceptive/proprioceptive/body awareness as possible endophenotypes in families with symptomatic gJHM or JHS/EDS-HT is also suggested. Concluding remarks addressed the implications of the psychopathological features of gJHM and JHS/EDS-HT in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Summary: Presented here is the conceptual basis for the assertion that the spinal stabilizing system consists of three subsystems. The vertebrae, discs, and ligaments constitute the passive subsystem. All muscles and tendons surrounding the spinal column that can apply forces to the spinal column constitute the active subsystem. The nerves and central nervous system comprise the neural subsystem, which determines the requirements for spinal stability by monitoring the various transducer signals, and directs the active subsystem to provide the needed stability. A dysfunction of a component of any one of the subsystems may lead to one or more of the following three possibilities: (a) an immediate response from other subsystems to successfully compensate, (b) a long-term adaptation response of one or more subsystems, and (c) an injury to one or more components of any subsystem. It is conceptualized that the first response results in normal function, the second results in normal function but with an altered spinal stabilizing system, and the third leads to overall system dysfunction, producing, for example, low back pain. In situations where additional loads or complex postures are anticipated, the neural control unit may alter the muscle recruitment strategy, with the temporary goal of enhancing the spine stability beyond the normal requirements.

The POM showed very good reliability as indicated by high internal consistency and moderate validity as indicated by significant correlations with the pain at rest, the NDI, and the SF-36. No correlations were found for POM with range of motion. The POM further proved to be responsive as it was sensitive to changes over time, and those changes were correlated to changes in pain intensity and NDI.{$<$}/p{$>$}

  abstract = {Background: Apart from the cranio-cervical flexion test and the deep neck flexor endurance test, evidence related to reliability of cervical movement control dysfunction tests is lacking.
Objectives: This study investigated the inter- and intra-tester reliability of a battery of cervical movement control dysfunction tests and the effect of clinician experience on reliability in 15 patients with chronic neck pain and 17 non-neck pain controls. In addition, it explored whether impaired performance on this battery of tests was more frequently observed in the neck pain group. Design: Inter and intra-tester reliability study.
Method: Participants were videotaped while performing a battery of nine active cervical movement control dysfunction tests. Two physiotherapists, with different levels of experience, independently rated all tests on two occasions two weeks apart. They were masked to participants' neck pain or non-neck pain status.
Results: Inter-tester reliability for the complete battery of tests was substantial (k \textonequarter{} 0.69; 95\% CI: 0.62, 0.76). Intra-rater reliability values for the expert (k \textonequarter{} 0.86; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.92) and novice (k \textonequarter{} 0.76; 95\% confidence intervals (CI): 0.68, 0.84) were overall comparable suggesting that novices can achieve good accuracy with the battery of tests if trained. The frequency of impaired performances in cervical movement control dysfunction tests was low and comparable between groups. Only two tests achieved a greater number of impaired ratings in the patient group.
Conclusions: Although reliable, further research in larger neck pain populations is required to explore this battery of tests, in order to establish their diagnostic accuracy for identifying clinically relevant cervical movement control dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinicians frequently rely on subjective categorization of impairments in mobility, strength, and endurance for clinical decision-making; however, these assessments are often unreliable and lack sensitivity to change. The objective of this study was to determine the inter-rater reliability, minimum detectable change (MDC), and group differences in quantitative cervicothoracic measures for individuals with and without chronic neck pain (NP).
Methods: Nineteen individuals with NP and 20 healthy controls participated in this case control study. Two physical therapists performed a 30-minute examination on separate days. A handheld dynamometer, gravity inclinometer, ruler, and stopwatch were used to quantify cervical range of motion (ROM), cervical muscle strength and endurance, and scapulothoracic muscle length and strength, respectively.
Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients for inter-rater reliability were significantly greater than zero for most impairment measures, with point estimates ranging from 0.45 to 0.93. The NP group exhibited reduced cervical ROM (P {$\leq$} 0.012) and muscle strength (P {$\leq$} 0.038) in most movement directions, reduced cervical extensor endurance (P = 0.029), and reduced rhomboid and middle trapezius muscle strength (P {$\leq$} 0.049).
Conclusions: Results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining objective cervicothoracic impairment measures with acceptable inter-rater agreement across time. The clinical utility of these measures is supported by evidence of impaired mobility, strength, and endurance among patients with NP, with corresponding MDC values that can help establish benchmarks for clinically significant change.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neck flexor muscle endurance has been negatively correlated with cervical pain and dysfunction. The purposes of this study were to determine rater reliability in subjects both with and without neck pain and to determine whether there was a difference in neck flexor muscle endurance between the 2 groups.
SUBJECTS: Forty-one subjects with and without neck pain were enrolled in this repeated-measures reliability study.
METHODS: Two raters used an isometric neck retraction test to assess neck flexor muscle endurance for all subjects during an initial session, and subjects without neck pain returned for testing 1 week later.
RESULTS: For the group without neck pain, intrarater reliability was good to excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC(3,1)]=.82-.91), and interrater reliability was moderate to good (ICC[2,1]=.67-.78). The associated standard error of measurement (SEM) ranged from 8.0 to 11.0 seconds and from 12.6 to 15.3 seconds, respectively. For the group with neck pain, interrater reliability was moderate (ICC[2,1]=.67, SEM=11.5). Neck flexor muscle endurance test results for the group without neck pain (mean=38.95 seconds, SD=26.4) and the group with neck pain (mean=24.1 seconds, SD=12.8) were significantly different.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Reliability coefficients differed between the 2 groups and ranged from moderate to excellent and improved after the first test session. The interrater reliability of data obtained with the neck flexor muscle endurance test in people with neck pain must be improved in order for clinicians to distinguish a clinically meaningful change from measurement error. Neck flexor muscle endurance was both statistically and clinically greater for subjects without neck pain than for those with neck pain.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Observational prospective study.
OBJECTIVE: Validate the Spanish version of the Neck Disability Index (NDI).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The NDI is the most widely used neck pain scale in the largest number of populations and has been validated most often against multiple measurements of function, pain, and clinical signs and symptoms.
METHODS: The Spanish version of the NDI was administered 2 or 3 times to 175 individuals with neck pain (including those requesting or not requesting specific healthcare at a given time and those with acute and subacute/chronic nonspecific or post-traumatic neck pain). After establishing the factorial structure by extracting the main components, the internal consistency was assessed with the Cronbach alpha method, the test-retest reliability was assessed with the Bland-Altman plot and the intraclass correlation coefficient methods, and the validity was established by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient with pain visual analogue scale values and with Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (Spanish version) values. Sensitivity to change was estimated while comparing the mean difference between the first application of the NDI score and the one after the treatment in the patients who improved, felt the same, or worsened.
RESULTS: A single factor explained 51.6\% of the variance, the Cronbach alpha score was 0.89, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.98, the Pearson correlation coefficient with pain visual analogue scale was r = 0.65 and with Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire was r = 0.89. In the subgroup of 147 subjects in whom the sensitivity to change was studied, those who reported an improvement in neck pain showed a decrease in the NDI score of 8.20, those who felt the same showed a decrease of 0.23, and those who felt worse showed an increase of 5.55.
CONCLUSION: This first Spanish version of the Neck Disability Index is reliable, valid, and sensitive to change.},

This article describes the development and preliminary validation of the CAE, derived from a sample of coUege students (N = 592). The data were analysed both by items and by sub-scales, and used exploratory factor analysis. Results showred a clear seven-factor structure involving the seven basic coping styles. Low to mod\'erate correlations were found between the seven factors. The Cronbach's alpha reliabilities of the subscales ranged from 0.64 to 0.92 (mean = 0.79). A second-order factor solution showed a two-factor structure involving rational and emotion focused coping. Results showed also that women were more likely than men to engage (to report) in most coping strategies.},

  abstract = {Background: Since its creation the STAI has been cited in more than 14,000 documents, with more than 60 adaptations in different countries. In some adaptations this instrument has no clinical scores. The aim of this work is to determine if the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) has higher scores in patients diagnosed with anxiety than in general population. In addition, we want to examine if the internal consistency is adequate in anxious patient samples.
Methods: We performed a literature search in Tripdatabase, Cochrane, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, PyscINFO and Scholar Google, for documents published between 2008 y 2012. We selected 131 scientific articles to compare between patients diagnosed with anxiety and general population, and 25 for the generalization of reliability. For the analysis we used Cohen's d for means comparisons (random-effects method) and Cronbach's alpha for the reliability generalization (fixed-effects method).
Results: In the groups comparision the differences in state anxiety (d=1.39; CI95\%: 1.22-1.56) and in the trait anxiety (d=1.74; CI95\%:1.561.91) were significants. The reliability for patients of some anxiety disorder was between 0.87 and 0.93.
Conclusions: So it seems that the STAI is sensitive to the level of anxiety of the individual and reliable for patients with diagnosis of panic attack, specific phobia, social phobia, generalized social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder or acute Stress disorder.},

  abstract = {The aim of this Review is to give a short presentation of the manifestations, assessment methods, and mechanisms underlying localized and widespread musculoskeletal pain, deep somatic tissue hyperalgesia and chronification. Hyperalgesia can be explained by increased pain sensitivity of nociceptors located in deep tissue (peripheral sensitization) or by increased responses from dorsal horn neurons (central sensitization). The spreading of pain and sensitization is related to increased synaptic activity in central neurons and to changes in descending control from supraspinal centers. Manifestations related to the different aspects of sensitization can be assessed quantitatively using sensory tests, such as pressure algometry (quantitative palpation) and cuff-algometry. Repeated pressure stimulation can evaluate the degree of temporal summation, which is a proxy for the level of central sensitization, as is expanded referred muscle pain area. The transition of acute localized musculoskeletal pain into chronic widespread pain is related to the progression of peripheral and central sensitization. This sensitization for the chronification of pain should be assessed by adequate pain biomarkers. Furthermore, pain prevention should target early intervention strategies and new anti-hyperalgesic compounds should be developed.},

This analysis aimed to determine reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the pain on movement (POM) questionnaire, an instrument developed to determine pain intensity induced by head movement.

DESIGN
Data from nine randomized controlled trials for the treatment of chronic nonspecific neck pain were reanalyzed to determine reliability and validity of the POM questionnaire.

METHODS
POM was assessed as ratings of pain intensity induced by head movement in six different directions. The instrument's structure was assessed using a factor analysis. Reliability (internal consistency) was determined using Cronbach's alpha, and validity (convergent validity) was determined by correlating the POM with pain at rest on a visual analog scale (VAS), the neck disability index (NDI), quality of life (short-form 36 health survey questionnaire [SF-36]) and range of motion. Responsiveness was indicated by sensitivity to changes over time in a subsample of 49 patients.

RESULTS
Overall, 482 patients (mean age 50.3 {$\pm$} 12.4 years, 72.3\% female) were included in the analysis, and 458 of them provided complete data set for the POM. Average POM was 43.9 {$\pm$} 20.8 mm on the VAS. The POM showed very good reliability as indicated by high internal consistency and moderate validity as indicated by significant correlations with the pain at rest, the NDI, and the SF-36. No correlations were found for POM with range of motion. The POM further proved to be responsive as it was sensitive to changes over time, and those changes were correlated to changes in pain intensity and NDI.

The POM seems to be a reliable and valid instrument to assess POM in patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain.},

  url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592364/},
  abstract = {Background:
Given the strong influence of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors on musculoskeletal symptoms and limitations it's important that both scientific and lay writing use the most positive, hopeful, and adaptive words and concepts consistent with medical evidence. The use of words that might reinforce misconceptions about preference-sensitive conditions (particularly those associated with age) could increase symptoms and limitations and might also distract patients from the treatment preferences they would select when informed and at ease.

Methods:
We reviewed 100 consecutive papers published in 2014 and 2015 in 6 orthopedic surgery scientific journals. We counted the number and proportion of journal articles with questionable use of one or more of the following words: tear, aggressive, required, and fail. For each word, we counted the rate of misuse per journal and the number of specific terms misused per article per journal

Results:
Eighty percent of all orthopedic scientific articles reviewed had questionable use of at least one term. Tear was most questionably used with respect to rotator cuff pathology. The words fail and require were the most common questionably used terms overall.

Conclusion:
The use of questionable words and concepts is common in scientific writing in orthopedic surgery. It's worth considering whether traditional ways or referring to musculoskeletal illness merit rephrasing.},

  abstract = {Aim
To investigate the correlation between the length of the title of a scientific article and the number of citations it receives, in view of the common editorial call for shorter titles.

Methods
Title and the number of citations to all articles published in 2005 in 22 arbitrarily chosen English-language journals (n\,=\,9031) were retrieved from citation database Scopus. The 2008 journal impact factors of these 22 journals were also retrieved from Thomson Reuters' Journal Citation Report (JCR). Assuming the article title length as the independent variable, and the number of citations to the article as the dependent variable, a linear regression model was applied.

Results
The slope of the regression line for some journals (n\,=\,6, when titles were measured in characters but 7 when titles were measured in words) was negative \textendash{} none was significantly different from 0. The overall slope for all journals was 0.140 (when titles were measured in characters) and 0.778 (when titles were measured in words), significantly different from 0 (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Overall, articles with longer titles received more citations \textendash{} Spearman {$\rho$}\,=\,0.266 \textendash{} when titles were measured in characters, and {$\rho$}\,=\,0.244 when titles were measured in words (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). This association was found for 7 of 8 journals with impact factor {$>$}10 and for 2 out of 14 journals with impact factor {$<$}10 (P\,{$<$}\,0.001, Fisher exact test).

Conclusion
Longer titles seem to be associated with higher citation rates. This association is more pronounced for journals with high impact factors. Editors who insist on brief and concise titles should perhaps update the guidelines for authors of their journals and have more flexibility regarding the length of the title.},

  abstract = {Background
The number of citations received is considered an index of study quality and impact. We aimed to examine the factors associated with the number of citations of published articles, focusing on the article length.

Methods
Original human studies published in the first trimester of 2006 in 5 major General Medicine journals were analyzed with regard to the number of authors and of author-affiliated institutions, title and abstract word count, article length (number of print pages), number of bibliographic references, study design, and 2006 journal impact factor (JIF). A multiple linear regression model was employed to identify the variables independently associated with the number of article citations received through January 2012.

Results
On univariate analysis the JIF, number of authors, article length, study design (interventional/observational and prospective/retrospective), title and abstract word count, number of author-affiliated institutions, and number of references were all associated with the number of citations received. On multivariate analysis with the logarithm of citations as the dependent variable, only article length [regression coefficient: 14.64 (95\% confidence intervals: (5.76\textendash{}23.50)] and JIF [3.37 (1.80\textendash{}4.948)] independently predicted the number of citations. The variance of citations explained by these parameters was 51.2\%.

Conclusion
In a sample of articles published in major General Medicine journals, in addition to journal impact factors, article length and number of authors independently predicted the number of citations. This may reflect a higher complexity level and quality of longer and multi-authored studies.},

We consider CIEs arising from nonoverlapping batch means, overlapping batch means, and standardized time series, all of which are commonly used in discrete-event simulation. The performance measures of interest are the coverage probability, and the expected value and variance of the half-length. We use empirical and analytical methods to make detailed comparisons regarding the behavior of the CIEs for a variety of stochastic processes. All the CIEs under study are asymptotically valid; however, they are usually invalid for small sample sizes. We find that for small samples, the bias of the variance parameter estimator figures significantly in CIE coverage performance-the less bias the better. A secondary role is played by the marginal distribution of the stationary process. We also point out that some CIEs require fewer observations before manifesting the properties for CIE validity.},

Methods: 1,202 consecutive patients, diagnosed pathologically with NSCLC from January 1999 to December 2009, were entered in this study. To obtain optimal cutoff points of CYFRA21-1 for these endpoints, a running log-rank statistical method was applied. Results: The cutoff level for the maximum log-rank statistical value of one-year survival in patients with NSCLC was 18.0 ng/ml. These results could be applied to patients with squamous cell carcinoma. In multivariate analysis, elevated ({$>$}18.0 ng/ml) levels of CYFRA21-1 was confirmed as being an unfavourable prognostic factor. Conclusion: CYFRA21-1 assay has a clinical significance for identifying patients with poor prognosis among those with early and advanced NSCLC. Elevated serum CYFRA21-1 levels at the time of diagnosis may be a useful noninvasive marker for identifying the risk of early death from NSCLC.},

  abstract = {Applied Survival Analysis Using R covers the main principles of survival analysis, gives examples of how it is applied, and teaches how to put those principles to use to analyze data using R as a vehicle. Survival data, where the primary outcome is time to a specific event, arise in many areas of biomedical research, including clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and studies of animals. Many survival methods are extensions of techniques used in linear regression and categorical data, while other aspects of this field are unique to survival data. This text employs numerous actual examples to illustrate survival curve estimation, comparison of survivals of different groups, proper accounting for censoring and truncation, model variable selection, and residual analysis.Because explaining survival analysis requires more advanced mathematics than many other statistical topics, this book is organized with basic concepts and most frequently used procedures covered in earlier chapters, with more advanced topics near the end and in the appendices. A background in basic linear regression and categorical data analysis, as well as a basic knowledge of calculus and the R system, will help the reader to fully appreciate the information presented. Examples are simple and straightforward while still illustrating key points, shedding light on the application of survival analysis in a way that is useful for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners in biostatistics.},

We conducted Monte Carlo simulation studies not only to evaluate the familywise error rate and power of the proposed procedure but also to compare the procedure with conventional methods. The proposed method is also applied to the data set consisting of 815 patients on a liver transplant waiting list from 1990 to 1999. It was found that the proposed method can control the type I error rate, and it yielded similar power as Tukey's and high power with respect to the other adjustment procedures. In addition to having a straightforward formula, it is easy to implement.},

Its popularity results from a wide choice of correlated error models compared to other software, e.g. PROC GLM. However, PROC MIXED's versatility comes at a price. Users must take care. Problems may result from MIXED defaults. These include: questionable criteria for selecting correlated error models; starting values that may impede REML estimation of covariance components; and biased standard errors and test statistics. Problems may be induced by inadequate design. This paper is a survey of current knowledge about mixed model methods for repeated measures.

  abstract = {Background
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a leading cause of death in the USA. We evaluated the incidence and predictors of AAA in a prospectively followed cohort.

Methods
We calculated age-adjusted AAA incidence rates (IR) among 18 782 participants aged {$\geq$}65 years in the Southern Community Cohort Study who received Medicare coverage from 1999\textendash{}2012, and assessed predictors of AAA using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, overall and stratified by sex, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic, medical and other factors. HRs and 95\% CIs were calculated for AAA in relation to factors ascertained at enrolment.

Results
Over a median follow-up of 4.94 years, 281 cases were identified. Annual IR was 153/100 000, 401, 354 and 174 among blacks, whites, men and women, respectively. AAA risk was lower among women (HR 0.48, 95\% CI 0.36 to 0.65) and blacks (HR 0.51, 95\% CI 0.37 to 0.69). Smoking was the strongest risk factor (former: HR 1.91, 95\% CI 1.27 to 2.87; current: HR 5.55, 95\% CI 3.67 to 8.40), and pronounced in women (former: HR 3.4, 95\% CI 1.83 to 6.31; current: HR 9.17, 95\% CI 4.95 to 17). A history of hypertension (HR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.04 to 2.01) and myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass surgery (HR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.37 to 2.63) was negatively associated, whereas a body mass index {$\geq$}25 kg/m2 (HR 0.72; 95\% CI 0.53 to 0.98) was protective. College education (HR 0.6, 95\% CI 0.37 to 0.97) and black race (HR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.28 to 0.67) were protective among men.

Conclusions
Smoking is a major risk factor for incident AAA, with a strong and similar association between men and women. Further studies are needed to evaluate benefits of ultrasound screening for AAA among women smokers.},

A systematic review and meta-analysis was therefore conducted to clarify this association. We searched PubMed and Embase databases up to May 2nd 2018. A random effects model was used to estimate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Twenty three prospective studies were included. Comparing current, former and ever smokers with never smokers the summary RRs were 4.87 (95\% CI: 3.93\textendash{}6.02, I2\,=\,92\%, n\,=\,20), 2.10 (95\% CI: 1.76\textendash{}2.50, I2\,=\,71\%, n\,=\,15) and 3.28 (95\% CI: 2.60\textendash{}4.15, I2\,=\,96\%, n\,=\,18), respectively. The summary RR was 1.87 (95\% CI: 1.45\textendash{}2.40, I2\,=\,97\%) per 10 cigarettes per day, 1.78 (95\% CI: 1.54\textendash{}2.06, I2\,=\,83\%) per 10 pack-years was and 0.45 (95\% CI: 0.32\textendash{}0.63, I2\,=\,92.3\%) per 10 years of smoking cessation. There was evidence of nonlinearity for cigarettes per day and pack-years (pnonlinearity\,{$<$}\,0.0001 and pnonlinearity\,=\,0.02, respectively), but not for smoking cessation, pnonlinearity\,=\,0.85. Among smokers who quit, the RR was similar to that of never smokers by 25 years of smoking cessation.

  abstract = {Background
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an insidious condition with an 85\% chance of death after rupture. Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality, but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at risk.
Methods
We used data from a retrospective cohort of 3.1 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of AAA by Life Line Screening in 2003 to 2008. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
Results
We observed a positive association with increasing years of smoking and cigarettes smoked and a negative association with smoking cessation. Excess weight was associated with increased risk, whereas exercise and consumption of nuts, vegetables, and fruits were associated with reduced risk. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians had lower risk of AAA than whites and Native Americans. Well-known risk factors were reaffirmed, including male gender, age, family history, and cardiovascular disease. A predictive scoring system was created that identifies aneurysms more efficiently than current criteria and includes women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged {$<$}65 years. Using this model on national statistics of risk factors prevalence, we estimated 1.1 million AAAs in the United States, of which 569,000 are among women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged {$<$}65 years.
Conclusions
Smoking cessation and a healthy lifestyle are associated with lower risk of AAA. We estimated that about half of the patients with AAA disease are not eligible for screening under current guidelines. We have created a high-yield screening algorithm that expands the target population for screening by including at-risk individuals not identified with existing screening criteria.},

Next to model formulation, this edition puts major emphasis on exploratory data analysis for all aspects of the model, such as the marginal model, subject-specific profiles, and residual covariance structure. Further, model diagnostics and missing data receive extensive treatment. Sensitivity analysis for incomplete data is given a prominent place. Several variations to the conventional linear mixed model are discussed (a heterogeity model, conditional linear mixed models). This book will be of interest to applied statisticians and biomedical researchers in industry, public health organizations, contract research organizations, and academia. The book is explanatory rather than mathematically rigorous. Most analyses were done with the MIXED procedure of the SAS software package, and many of its features are clearly elucidated. However, some other commercially available packages are discussed as well. Great care has been taken in presenting the data analyses in a software-independent fashion.

Response levels in this model gradually move toward an asymptote or equilibrium which depends on covariates and random effects. The book provides relationships of the autoregressive linear mixed effects models with linear mixed effects models, marginal models, transition models, nonlinear mixed effects models, growth curves, differential equations, and state space representation. State space representation with a modified Kalman filter provides log likelihoods for maximum likelihood estimation, and this representation is suitable for unequally spaced longitudinal data. The extension to multivariate longitudinal data analysis is also provided. Topics in medical fields, such as response-dependent dose modifications, response-dependent dropouts, and randomized controlled trials are discussed.

There are several different frequently used bootstrapping methods for this purpose. Here we demonstrate that authors of recent papers frequently do not specify the method they have used and that different methods can produce markedly different confidence intervals for the same sample and parameter estimate. We encourage authors to be more explicit about the method they use (and number of bootstrap resamples used). We recommend the bias corrected and accelerated method as giving generally good performance; although researchers should be warned that coverage of bootstrap confidence intervals is characteristically less than the specified nominal level, and confidence interval evaluation by any method can be unreliable for small samples in some situations.},

  abstract = {Background
Testing dependence/correlation of two variables is one of the fundamental tasks in statistics. In this work, we proposed a new way of testing nonlinear dependence between two continuous variables (X and Y).

Results
We addressed this research question by using CANOVA (continuous analysis of variance, software available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/canova/). In the CANOVA framework, we first defined a neighborhood for each data point related to its X value, and then calculated the variance of the Y value within the neighborhood. Finally, we performed permutations to evaluate the significance of the observed values within the neighborhood variance. To evaluate the strength of CANOVA compared to six other methods, we performed extensive simulations to explore the relationship between methods and compared the false positive rates and statistical power using both simulated and real datasets (kidney cancer RNA-seq dataset).

Conclusions
We concluded that CANOVA is an efficient method for testing nonlinear correlation with several advantages in real data applications.

The value of survival analysis is not confined to medical statistics, where the benefit of the analysis of data on such factors as life expectancy and duration of periods of freedom from symptoms of a disease as related to a treatment applied individual histories and so on, is obvious. The techniques also find important applications in industrial life testing and a range of subjects from physics to econometrics.

  abstract = {Critically acclaimed and resoundingly popular in its first edition, Modelling Survival Data in Medical Research has been thoroughly revised and updated to reflect the many developments and advances--particularly in software--made in the field over the last 10 years. Now, more than ever, it provides an outstanding text for upper-level and graduate courses in survival analysis, biostatistics, and time-to-event analysis.The treatment begins with an introduction to survival analysis and a description of four studies that lead to survival data. Subsequent chapters then use those data sets and others to illustrate the various analytical techniques applicable to such data, including the Cox regression model, the Weibull proportional hazards model, and others. This edition features a more detailed treatment of topics such as parametric models, accelerated failure time models, and analysis of interval-censored data. The author also focuses the software section on the use of SAS, summarising the methods used by the software to generate its output and examining that output in detail. Profusely illustrated with examples and written in the author's trademark, easy-to-follow style, Modelling Survival Data in Medical Research, Second Edition is a thorough, practical guide to survival analysis that reflects current statistical practices.},

  abstract = {Analysis of Failure and Survival Data is an essential textbook for graduate-level students of survival analysis and reliability and a valuable reference for practitioners. It focuses on the many techniques that appear in popular software packages, including plotting product-limit survival curves, hazard plots, and probability plots in the context of censored data. The author integrates S-Plus and Minitab output throughout the text, along with a variety of real data sets so readers can see how the theory and methods are applied. He also incorporates exercises in each chapter that provide valuable problem-solving experience. In addition to all of this, the book also brings to light the most recent linear regression techniques. Most importantly, it includes a definitive account of the Buckley-James method for censored linear regression, found to be the best performing method when a Cox proportional hazards method is not appropriate.Applying the theories of survival analysis and reliability requires more background and experience than students typically receive at the undergraduate level. Mastering the contents of this book will help prepare students to begin performing research in survival analysis and reliability and provide seasoned practitioners with a deeper understanding of the field.},

  abstract = {Time-to-event outcomes are common in medical research as they offer more information than simply whether or not an event occurred. To handle these outcomes, as well as censored observations where the event was not observed during follow-up, survival analysis methods should be used. Kaplan-Meier estimation can be used to create graphs of the observed survival curves, while the log-rank test can be used to compare curves from different groups. If it is desired to test continuous predictors or to test multiple covariates at once, survival regression models such as the Cox model or the accelerated failure time model (AFT) should be used. The choice of model should depend on whether or not the assumption of the model (proportional hazards for the Cox model, a parametric distribution of the event times for the AFT model) is met. The goal of this paper is to review basic concepts of survival analysis. Discussions relating the Cox model and the AFT model will be provided. The use and interpretation of the survival methods model are illustrated using an artificially simulated dataset.},

  abstract = {As a follow-up to a previous article, this review provides several in-depth concepts regarding a survival analysis. Also, several codes for specific survival analysis are listed to enhance the understanding of such an analysis and to provide an applicable survival analysis method. A proportional hazard assumption is an important concept in survival analysis. Validation of this assumption is crucial for survival analysis. For this purpose, a graphical analysis method and a goodnessof- fit test are introduced along with detailed codes and examples. In the case of a violated proportional hazard assumption, the extended models of a Cox regression are required. Simplified concepts of a stratified Cox proportional hazard model and time-dependent Cox regression are also described. The source code for an actual analysis using an available statistical package with a detailed interpretation of the results can enable the realization of survival analysis with personal data. To enhance the statistical power of survival analysis, an evaluation of the basic assumptions and the interaction between variables and time is important. In doing so, survival analysis can provide reliable scientific results with a high level of confidence.},
